text: JK Rowling Confirms Stance Against Transgender Women It‚Äôs been a long time coming, but finally we have a definitive answer. JK Rowling is a TERF. There have been multiple instances wherein the (in)famous Harry Potter author demonstrated solidarity with radical feminists who have waged a vicious smear campaign against transgender women. Once, she blamed liking anti-transgender statuses on Twitter as an error, dubbing it a ‚ÄúClumsy and Middle-Aged Moment.‚Äù Despite fans catching the 53 year old in the act of putting her stamp of approval on trans hate once again, she thumbed her nose at the backlash. Rowling eagerly co-signed the Anti-Trans attacks launched by notorious The Times journalist Janice Turner. Most recently, Turner led a hate-motivated campaign against UK children‚Äôs charity National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children who had enlisted transgender model Munroe Bergdorf in a partnership to expand efforts to reach vulnerable LGBT children. Turner took to twitter where she accused Bergdorf of being a ‚Äúporn model‚Äù and encouraged supporters to consider suspending direct debit donations to the charity. While the LGBT community and our allies have stood back and watched a rather ominous narrative form around JK Rowling, it has been without any direct confirmation or statement from the author herself. It‚Äôs as if she is conditioning the world to accept it rather than rebuke it. First she stuck her toe in the water, was caught, claimed it was a misunderstanding and we accepted that. Then, she persisted to do the same things‚Ä¶ again and again. Finally, we have some confirmation of Rowling‚Äôs stance against the transgender community. She has followed one of the most hateful and aggressive anti-trans radical feminists on Twitter, Magdalen Berns. Out of her 14 million followers, Rowling herself follows less than 700 people on social media, so it‚Äôs safe to presume her perspective aligns with that of the well known transphobe whose account is solely committed to espousing misinformation and dangerous rhetoric toward transgender women. This clearly isn‚Äôt another middle-aged moment. Instead, it seems more like Rowling unapologetically pulling back the curtain and finally ending what little left there was to speculate about with any optimism. Twitter has postured itself as something of a safe-house for TERFs. You don‚Äôt have to deep-dive to see those leaders of the anti-trans movement all follow each other and retweet each other‚Äôs journalistic hit pieces and clever jibes that attack trans identities. Graham Linehan, Posie Parker, Janice Turner, Julie Bindel, Women Place UK, Mumsnet and Magdalen all present themselves as soldiers on the frontline in their war on transgender women. Some dedicate their efforts to harassing and bullying transwomen on the platform while others actually tour the country to proselytize to other women and recruit them into their radical ideologies. Twitter did permanently ban radfem warrior Meghan Murphy who was constantly attacking transgender women, misgendering them, deadnaming them and dog whistling her fellow radicals to join her in the targeted take-down-of-the-day. She treated hunting us as a sport on Twitter. She thinks hate speech is an exercise of free speech, yet forgets that hate has consequences. This group coordinates their efforts to damage trans people. They provoke violence against the trans community. They spread malignant lies to spark fear and breed intolerance. The time they invest in this is alarming. However, it still took years to finally allow Murphy enough rope to get herself banned. Twitter typically takes a passive stance on TERF‚Äôs and have even banned trans women for defending themselves against members of this very group of radicals. To see JK Rowling lock arms with this form of hatred, targeting a minority community while having the ear of millions of young children is deeply saddening. An enormous demographic of her audience is LGBT; Kids who identified with fighting forces of evil for their right to exist, their right to equality, their access to opportunity. Now, an entire generation of adults who used the Harry Potter books to navigate the rough terrain of life‚Äôs trials and tribulations must reckon with the fact that their literary darling is not the progressive fighter for social justice she pretended to be. In fact, many transgender fans are having to reconcile that she‚Äôs lending her support to those who wish to fight them back into silence instead.

Play video content WBFF Fox 45  Mayor Brown said officers were told to be careful and protect our residents, protect peaceful protesters and use common sense. He said he would not call for the firing off the 2 officers involved in the Gugino incident, and wanted them to have due process.  As you know, Gugino was standing all by himself when he was shoved to the ground, and left bleeding from the head and ear.  As we reported, 57 other officers resigned from Buffalo's Emergency Response Team in solidarity with the 2 cops who were suspended for the incident.  Gugino remains hospitalized, but his attorney says he is alert and oriented.

text: Scottish Parliament should return to business, say Tories Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday that former Vice President Joe Biden is "considering" forgiving $50,000 in federal student loan debt for every borrower with an annual salary of under $125,000 ‚Äî a move that would place an incredibly heavy burden on taxpayers. More than 40 million Americans currently have outstanding federal loans, amounting to a whopping total of $1.54 trillion in debt. What did he say? "We have come to the conclusion that President Biden can undo this debt, can forgive $50,000 of debt the first day he becomes president," Schumer announced to supporters outside of his New York office. "You don't need Congress; all you need is the flick of a pen. "I have told him how important it is. He is considering it," Schumer added after a reporter asked if he had spoken to Biden about the proposal. "We believe he does [have the executive authority], and he's researching that. I believe that when he does his research, he will find that he does." During the 2020 Democratic primary, Biden expressed support for a Democratic legislative proposal that would immediately cancel up to $10,000 in debt for each borrower. But since then, progressives in the party have been urging the former vice president to bypass Congress and cancel the debt by executive fiat. Whether it is constitutional for a president to take such an action remains in question. What else? Later during the event, a reporter pressed Schumer on the equity of debt cancelation. "What about the families that have made sacrifices to pay off the student loans for their students? What about the students who have paid off their student loans?" the reporter asked. "Look," Schumer responded, "lots of students paid off student loans, but it's such a burden it's good for everybody to make sure this debt is vanquished." After the event had concluded, one of individuals standing next to Schumer, mocked the reporter's question, brushing it off as just the "Fox News perspective" on the issue. "These people have great futures, but they are burdened by debt ... we want to remove it," Schumer had plainly stated during the event. Yet, despite Schumer's portrayal of debt cancelation as an obvious, kind solution, in reality, it is far from either. As TheBlaze previously reported, contrary to what progressive politicians claim, "'canceling debt' is not something that actually exists. Lawmakers could remove a borrower's liability for re-paying the debt, but the debt will be shifted onto someone" and "in the case of federal student loans, the burden would be further shifted onto taxpayers."

text: Junior doctors row: 98% vote in favour of strikes Junior doctors in England have overwhelmingly voted in favour of going on strike in their dispute with ministers over a new contract.  Some 98% voted in favour of a full strike and 99% in favour of action just short of a full strike.  The first walk-out will start on 1 December with another two dates earmarked for later in the month.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the doctors' decision was very, very disappointing news.  And he rejected calls for talks to be held at conciliation service Acas, although he would not rule it out completely.  Study after study has shown that our mortality rates at weekends are too high, he said. media captionIn full: Jeremy Hunt interview with Laura Kuenssberg  We put forward a very fair offer for doctors, which will see pay go up for three-quarters of junior doctors. We wanted to talk about this to them, but in the end they have chosen to strike so we will have to put in contingency plans.  He also said that the government's offer had been misrepresented. 'Unsafe contract'  The British Medical Association BMA said it was inevitable disruption would be caused to patients as a result of the strikes, but maintained it had been left with no choice as the contract was unsafe.  The action is likely to lead to the cancelling and rescheduling of thousands of routine appointments, tests and operations with the NHS forced to prioritise emergency cases.  The union has asked the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service Acas to get involved to offer independent arbitration - something the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which normally stays out of politics, has said it supports.  The dates for industrial action are:      08:00 GMT 1 December to 08:00 GMT 2 December junior doctors to staff emergency care     08:00 GMT to 17:00 8 December full strike     08:00 GMT to 17:00 16 December full strike  The BMA balloted just over 37,700 members - over two-thirds of the workforce - and 76% took part in the ballot.  Paris attacks: The young doctor who treated first casualties line What will happen in a strike? Doctorimage copyrightPA  Services will be disrupted, make no mistake about that. But the British Medical Association argues the aim of doctors taking part will not be to maximise that - as is the goal in many other industrial disputes.  On the first day of action that has been earmarked, junior doctors will still staff emergency care. On the other two dates, they will walk out in the knowledge there will be other medics - consultants, staff doctors and locums - that can plug the gaps.  Whether that will be enough for hard-pressed emergency services will be argued over ahead, during and after any walkout.  What is certain, though, is routine services will suffer. Hip operations, knee replacement and routine clinics will have to be cancelled.  In fact, as happened the last time doctors took action in 2012, over pensions, expect hospitals to start rearranging services in advance. Want to know more about the dispute?      The junior doctors row explained     What exactly do junior doctors do?     A nightmare for the NHS and patients     How does your job compare?     NHS v ministers: A case of deja vu?  line  The vote comes after thousands of doctors have taken part in a series of protests in recent months in the contract dispute.  Talks broke down last year, and ministers have since said they will impose the new contract from next year.  As the ballot papers went out a fortnight ago, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt made a last ditch attempt to persuade doctors to accept the offer.  He wrote to all the doctors in the country with a fresh offer.  It included a promise of an 11% rise in basic pay, but the BMA said this was misleading as it was offset by curbs to other elements of the pay package, including unsociable hours payments.  Ministers have promised to protect pay for the first three years of the deal.  But the BMA has said there are insufficient safeguards to stop hospitals overworking doctors and they could lose out financially in the long term. Junior doctors row  55,000  junior doctors in England  37,700  balloted over industrial action      ¬£3.1bn spent on junior doctor pay currently      11% rise in basic pay offered      25% cut in weekly hours that attract a premium unsociable hours payment  Source: Department of Health and BMA Science Photo Library  After the result of the ballot was announced, BMA leader Dr Mark Porter said: We regret the inevitable disruption that this will cause but it is the government's adamant insistence on imposing a contract that is unsafe for patients in the future, and unfair for doctors now and in the future, that has brought us to this point.  Our message to him is that junior doctors have today made their views perfectly clear but that it is still possible to get back around the negotiating table to deliver a contract that is safe for patients, contains the necessary contractual safeguards to prevent junior doctors being overworked and properly recognises evening and weekend work.  Meanwhile, Labour shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander has written to the prime minister to ask him to intervene, saying the profession had lost confidence in Mr Hunt. She also wants to see independent arbitration.  The letter - seen by the BBC - says: With the NHS facing its most difficult winter in recent memory, and the prospect of industrial action now looming, it is imperative that urgent steps are taken to resolve this dispute. Graphic  Roger Goss, of the campaign group Patient Concern, criticised the way both sides had handled the dispute but said doctors should not go on strike.  This is the worst news for patients in the history of the NHS. What happened to the promise that the interests of patients are paramount and we put patients first?  Any honourable doctor with a genuine vocation who wants to preserve the high esteem which the medical profession currently enjoys will refuse to cause suffering inherent in a full-scale walk-out.  Scotland and Wales have said they do not want to introduce the contract changes, while Northern Ireland has yet to make a decision.
