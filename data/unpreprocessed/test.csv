81a67c96,"- The Washington Post Former state House Majority Leader Adam Hasner, now running in a crowded Republican primary to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson in 2012, came out swinging against the federal health-care law backed by President Barack Obama. On Wednesday morning, noting that oral arguments would begin in the constitutional challenge launched by Florida and other states against the law, Hasner insisted the health-care law was undermining economic recovery. Today, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeal in Atlanta will hear oral arguments from 26 states seeking to overturn President Obama and Senator Bill Nelson's unconstitutional health-care takeover. Led by Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, the states have already won significant legal victories against this overreach by the federal government, said Hasner. Attorney General Bondi is right to focus on the need for states to protect and defend the individual liberties of their citizens, as well as preserve the constitutional principle of limited government. But there is an important economic component to defeating Obamacare, as well. Implementation of Obamacare has played a major role in prolonging our country's economic challenges. Earlier this year, the head of the Congressional Budget Office testified before Congress that implementation of Obamacare would cost 800,000 jobs. Here in Florida, nearly 1 million Floridians are already out of work and the myriad regulations, taxes, and rules contained in Obamacare have only caused more worry and hesitation among the small-business men and women and job creators I've met with during the past three months, added Hasner. Individual liberty and limited government are paramount toward the defeat of Obamacare, but we should also never forget the incredible toll this massive overreach of government will take on our economic freedoms, as well. Getting Florida and America back to work requires expanding economic freedoms, and getting Washington regulations out of the way of job creators. There's no better place to start than by defeating Obamacare in the courts and repealing it in Congress.",partial
6e5ec6fb,"Rubio Comments on Iran Nuclear Deal Editor’s note: Subsequent to this article, VTDigger published a fact-check of the Col. Matthew Birmingham’s claim that police face a risk of death due to exposure to small amounts of opioids. A Vermont state trooper had to be revived by multiple doses of Narcan after he apprehended a man in a routine traffic stop. Get all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox. Acting Sgt. Brett Flansburg stopped a vehicle for a traffic violation in Leicester late Friday night and saw the driver, Taylor Woodward, 25, swallow a baggie that was later identified as a baggie of cocaine, police said. In a search of the vehicle, Flansburg collected a small quantity of heroin in a baggie. Woodward was then taken into custody by other troopers on the scene for processing on suspicion of possessing heroin, police said. Flansburg began to feel ill as he drove to the New Haven Barracks. When he arrived, he collapsed in the parking lot and was found unresponsive, police said. He was unresponsive when he was found by fellow troopers who immediately administered Narcan. In all, Flansburg received three doses of the opiate antidote in a row. He was rushed to UVM Medical Center in Burlington where he was treated and released, police said. Woodward was brought separately to UVMMC and did not need medical care. He will be arraigned May 6 in Vermont Superior Court, Criminal Division, in Middlebury. He faces a misdemeanor charge of heroin possession. The drug Flansburg was exposed to is being tested and the incident is under investigation. Col. Matthew Birmingham, director of the Vermont State Police, said in a press release that “being a state trooper is a dangerous and demanding job for all the reasons you’d expect: apprehending criminals, encountering volatile individuals, rushing toward emergencies rather than away. “Now there is a new threat that we’re seeing up close: the risk of exposure to powerful drugs that can kill in even tiny amounts,” Birmingham said. “This is so troubling and disconcerting, and it places members of law enforcement at unnecessary risk of possibly losing their lives.” “Were it not for the immediate availability of Narcan and the quick actions of his fellow troopers and medical personnel, we might be speaking today about the death of a trooper in the line of duty,” the colonel said. “I’m angry at how close we came, and relieved that the situation was no worse than it was.” Stay on top of all of Vermont's criminal justice news.

4a1a9b9f,"Who are the arsonists setting rural fires in Washington State? Urgent action to boost the number of children and young people receiving life-saving vaccinations will be set out by the Prime Minister today. Boris Johnson will visit a hospital in the South West and lay out a number of measures designed to improve vaccination rates, including for measles, mumps and rubella MMR. While confidence in the UK’s world-leading vaccination programme remains high – with uptake exceeding 90% for most childhood immunisations – there has been a small but steady decline in coverage in recent years. It means that the UK has lost its ‘measles-free’ status with the World Health Organisation WHO – three years after the virus was eliminated in the country. The WHO have stated that in the first six months of 2019 reported measles cases globally are almost three times as many as the same time last year. Measles is now endemic in countries including France, Germany and Italy. The PM has now called for health leaders to renew their efforts to meet 95% for both doses of MMR. Currently just 87% of children are getting their second dose of the jab, which has likely contributed to the spread of measles. Action to achieve this includes: NHS England writing to GPs urging them to promote ‘catch up’ vaccination programmes for MMR for 10-11 year olds, as well as all those 5-25 year olds who have not had two doses of the jab; Strengthening the role of local immunisation coordinators – healthcare professionals that promote vaccines particularly with hard-to-reach families. This includes supporting areas with low uptake and tailoring specific local interventions to under-vaccinated communities; Addressing parents’ concerns about vaccines by updating the advice on NHS.uk specifically to address misleading information about the dangers of vaccines, by giving people NHS-approved, evidence-based and trusted advice on vaccines including through a new website; Calling a summit of social media companies to discuss how they can play their part in promoting accurate information about vaccination; and The Department for Health and Social Care – working with Public Health England and NHS England – delivering a comprehensive strategy to address the issue in the Autumn. Ahead of the hospital visit Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: After a period of progress where we were once able to declare Britain measles free, we’ve now seen hundreds of cases of measles in the UK this year. One case of this horrible disease is too many, and I am determined to step up our efforts to tackle its spread. This is a global challenge and there’s a number of reasons why people don’t get themselves or their children the vaccines they need, but we need decisive action across our health service and society to make sure communities are properly immunised. From reassuring parents about the safety of vaccines, to making sure people are attending follow-up appointments, we can and must do more to halt the spread of infectious, treatable diseases in modern-day Britain. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: It’s easy to forget how devastating measles can be precisely because vaccines are so effective at preventing it in the first place. With this strategy, the whole health system will come together to renew focus on vaccinations – especially for our children – and this time we will eliminate measles for good. The Prime Minister’s visit to the South West is part of a series of visits to hospitals he is taking. He will meet doctors and nurses, hearing directly from them about what support they think the NHS needs so it can continue to be the best healthcare service in the world. Measles elimination status means that the virus is no longer circulating permanently in a country. The UK achieved measles-free status in 2016 after three years of limited spread due to high vaccination rates, but measles has since been spreading slowly in the UK for over 12 months. In the first quarter of 2019, there were 231 confirmed cases of measles in the UK. Many of these were acquired abroad with some onward spread in under-vaccinated communities. The Department for Health’s strategy to be published in the Autumn is also expected to: Ask the NHS to use technology to identify who may have missed a vaccination and make booking appointments easier, such as improved call/recall systems for those accessing immunisations, and more consistent use of these systems across UK healthcare to remind people of their vaccine appointments. As part of the GP contract review, examine wider questions of improving GP capacity to allow additional immunisation appointments – while also asking NHS England to consider other settings outside of a GP for vaccinations. Develop a major campaign with NHS England and Improvement, Public Health England and GP practices to support the importance of key vaccinations in protecting against potentially dangerous diseases. Work with DFE to explore more ways in which students can be informed about their health and wellbeing including the value of vaccinations – plus enabling them to critically assess misinformation spread online about certain vaccines. This comes as part of a wider government drive on Prevention, following the publication of the Prevention Green Paper last month. Head of Immunisation at Public Health England Dr Mary Ramsay said: Losing our ‘measles-free’ status is a stark reminder of how important it is that every eligible person gets vaccinated. Elimination can only be sustained by maintaining and improving coverage of the MMR vaccine. Measles is one of the most infectious diseases known to man – only one person travelling back to an area with lower vaccination rates can lead to an outbreak. Anyone who has not received two doses of MMR vaccine is always at risk.",fake
6d16fa40,"Diabetes prescriptions now cost NHS £1bn, figures show By Ken Allen AFSCME Council 75 represents the workers in the vast majority of the state corrections facilities in Oregon. Our members work hard to protect the public, while working with inmates incarcerated in 13 prisons throughout the state. While the majority of our members are corrections officers, we also represent counselors, dentists, food service workers, nurses, maintenance and clerical workers, among others. These jobs are tough, stressful and sometimes dangerous. The Oregon Legislature and governor are currently considering how to close a $340 million budget hole because tax revenues are less than expected when forecast last May. Part of a budget deal announced on the first day of this year's legislative session would close the Santiam Correctional Institution southeast of Salem. The estimated savings after closure in June would be $1.6 million. The governor and the Legislature should reconsider this plan. The closure plan and the numbers don't add up. The closure is a knee-jerk reaction to a real budget problem. The Santiam Correctional Institution holds 440 inmates. It is a minimum-security facility. Typically, minimum-security facilities are the cheapest to operate, followed by medium-security, with maximum-security facilities at the highest cost per inmate. The legislative plan is to release none of the 440 inmates, but ship them to other prisons throughout Oregon. Under the current plan, 50 percent of these minimum-security inmates would be then imprisoned in a higher-cost medium-security facility. All the 440 inmates would be pushed into an already overcrowded prison system. We have 395 inmates pushed into triple-bunked cells intended for two inmates and bunked in classrooms and areas supposed to be designated for inmate labor. We have units that were designated for 80 inmates with 120 inmates, with only one corrections officer supervising these inmates. We have units with blind spots, including no sightline to the bathroom, with only one corrections officer supervising 80 to 100 inmates. The plan to send 440 more inmates into an overcrowded system would create dangerous and hazardous work for our members and the inmates. Prison overcrowding leads to assaults on staff and other inmates and to lawsuits. The Department of Corrections believes it would have to reopen the facility 12 to 18 months later because of inmate population growth. The leadership of this union is opposed to the closure of the Santiam facility. Department leadership has asked legislators to let them find the $1.6 million of cuts in the budget of the whole department. Legislators should do their jobs to monitor budget needs, but none of them has ever even run a prison. Let the managers and workers at the Department of Corrections put together a plan to save $1.6 million. Don't close the Santiam Correctional Institution.

31d75b45,"Neil Mackay's Big Read: Inside Scotland’s education wars where parents, teachers and government are at daggers drawn Bernie Sanders, an independent, represents Vermont in the Senate and is a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president. Americans owe many of our freedoms to those who put their lives on the line for racial equality: people like Fannie Lou Hamer, Medgar Evers and Daisy Bates. But a racial wealth gap of 10 to 1 exists between white and black Americans, and that gap, along with the effects of racism, fuels disparities in areas ranging from health care to housing and from college debt to criminal sentencing. Many black Americans are disillusioned about politicians who champion the organizing power of black women when it’s time to turn out the vote but neglect their needs between election cycles. They are tired of politicians offering meaningful yet inadequate reforms — kicking the can of progress down the road instead of using their political capital to fight for reforms that current generations desperately need. They’re tired of coming in second to groups that hold the power of the purse or the might of demographic majority. And they’ve said enough is enough: The status quo is simply insufficient. I couldn’t agree more. Structural problems require structural solutions, and promises of mere “access” have never guaranteed black Americans equality in this country. Sixty-five years after Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, education has remained separate and unequal. “Access” to health care is an empty promise when you can’t afford high premiums, co-pays or deductibles. And an “opportunity” for an equal education is an opportunity in name only when you can’t afford to live in a good school district or to pay college tuition. Jobs, health care, criminal justice and education are linked, and progress will not be made unless we address the economic systems that oppress Americans at their root. As Princeton’s Keeanga Yamahtta-Taylor recently argued, “There is no race without class in this country.” Yet most politicians won’t acknowledge the role that our economic system plays in maintaining racial inequality. Example after example shows that corporate exploitation disproportionately affects black people. Black Americans lost 40 percent of their wealth in the 2009 housing crisis, and were the target of predatory lenders. Black Americans are more likely than white Americans to be paid a minimum wage salary, and black Americans stand to benefit disproportionately from a $15 an hour federal minimum wage. Walmart is the largest private employer of African Americans in the country — 42 percent of its associates are black. And it pays its employees below a living wage — even while the Walton family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of Americans. Former vice president Joe Biden recently said, “I don’t think 500 billionaires are the reason why we’re in trouble.” I respectfully disagree. It is my view that any presidential candidate who claims to believe that black lives matter has to take on the institutions that have continually exploited black lives. The racial wealth gap lingers in part because the politicians who could close it are funded by the very corporate donors who continue to benefit from it. Gross inequality persists largely unchallenged despite the United States’ massive wealth because myths about racial inferiority and the “undeserving poor” justify the worst effects of unfettered capitalism. As long as corporations can rely on the indifference to black lives as a cover for their exploitation, they will continue to do so. Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, argues powerfully that corporations play a central role in “sustaining, or worsening, the forces of racism in America,” whether by advancing racist stereotypes, sponsoring voter suppression or exploiting low-wage workers who are disproportionately black and brown. And he’s right. The unfortunate truth is that politicians who take checks from millionaires and billionaires owe their corporate constituents first, and everyday Americans last. The black-white wealth gap could be closed by targeting the extreme wealth at the very top. Instead, politicians beholden to the one percent ask the black middle class and the white middle class to fight over scraps. I’m proud that our campaign is fueled by more small-dollar donations than any other — more of our donors work at Walmart than any other company. Our willingness to take on powerful special interests as we fight for universal health care and a living wage — instead of the private prison industry and tax breaks for the rich — is a direct consequence of my campaign’s financial independence. The straightest path to racial equality is through the one percent. A system where we don’t address both racial and economic disparity is a system in which some people, especially African Americans, are going to be left behind. We should not be swayed by those who would try to force us to choose one over the other.",fake
073f3552,"European Court of Killers’ Rights EXCLUSIVE: Third of cases won by terrorists, murderers and lags EXCLUSIVE by TOM NEWTON DUNN, Political Editor 17th August 2015, 11:01 pm Updated: 5th April 2016, 8:00 pm A THIRD of those who have won against Britain at the European Court of Human Rights are terrorists, prisoners or criminals, figures show. Among claimants the court found in favour of since 1975 are murderers, terrorists in Iraq and IRA gunmen. Its recent controversial judgments include refusing a Home Office deportation order for Islamic hate preacher Abu Qatada and insisting prisoners must have the vote. The figures showing that the 297 victories against the UK included 94 prisoners, terrorists or criminals are revealed in a glossy dossier produced by ECHR-supporting pressure group RightsInfo. It is a response to criticisms of the Strasbourg court by Tory ministers and The Sun. Commons Justice Committee chairman Bob Neill MP said: “This is well beyond what any sensible person would say is real human rights. “It’s mission creep, law made by judges who are not judges and many from countries with questionable human rights and very little judicial experience. “Political pressure groups take advantage of that naivety, which costs the British taxpayer considerable sums.” It costs £286million a year to fund the euro judges’ governing body, the Council of Europe and £23million of that comes from British taxes. Since 1959, the UK has won only 41 per cent of 513 ECHR cases. RightsInfo’s Adam Wagner said: “People accused of crimes or convicted of offences have human rights too, so it isn’t surprising that they have featured in 40 years of cases.” The fanatic Hate preacher Abu Qatada Reuters 3 ABU Qatada won the right to stay in Britain rather than be deported to his homeland Jordan after ECHR judges said there was a risk evidence obtained by torture could be used against him in a terror trial. In that case Qatada, described as Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, would not get a fair trial. The Strasbourg court’s 2012 decision overturned a ruling by UK law lords. Qatada had been convicted in Jordan in 1999 in his absence of a conspiracy to carry out bombings. He was finally returned in 2013 after Jordan agreed torture evidence would not be used. PRISONER John Hirst first won the right for convicted criminals to vote following a European court ruling in 2005. Hirst had previously lost his claim at the High Court in 2001 but took the case to Europe and won. No UK Government has legislated on the issue despite four rulings in Hirst’s favour by the Strasbourg-based court. Hirst who served 25 years for the unprovoked manslaughter of his landlady, said: “You don’t lose your status in civil society just because you’re in prison — you are still a member of the public.” The IRA men Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis 3 TEN IRA men killed by soldiers and the Royal Ulster Constabulary had their human rights violated, the ECHR ruled in 2001. Its judges said the authorities failed to conduct proper inquiries into the deaths. The UK Government was ordered to pay each of the IRA men’s families £10,000. Tory and Ulster Unionist MPs said the ruling was a disgrace and an insult to those who tried to keep the peace. Unionist Ken Maginnis said: “It now seems common practice as far as the European Courts are concerned to pander to militant Irish republicanism.”",other
863897d7,"Dr. Didier Raoult published new results of 1,061 coronavirus patients treated using hdroxychloroquine with 91% success rate. Dr. Raoult found: “Hydroxychloroquine Azithromycin combination, when started immediately after diagnosis, is a safe and efficient treatment for COVID-19, with a mortality rate of 0.5%, in elderly patients. It avoids worsening and clears virus persistence and contagiosity in most cases.” We first wrote about renowned Dr. Didier Raoult after he and his team of French researchers conducted a study which showed that 100% of coronavirus patients that received a combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment. In a follow-up study, which has a larger sample size of 80 COVID-19 patients, the team found a clinical improvement in all but one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74-year old patient still in intensive care unit. The team also found that, by administering hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, they were able to observe an improvement in all cases, except in one patient who arrived with an advanced form, who was over the age of 86, and in whom the evolution was irreversible, according to a new paper published today in IHU Méditerranée Infection. We now have new updates. Tonight, Dr. Oz said during an interview that Dr. Raoult is about to publish the results of his new study. Dr. OZ announced that Dr. Didier Raoult has now treated 1000 coronavirus patient with 99.3% success rate. Of the 1000 patients treatments, 20 patients went to the ICU and 7 patients died. Dr. Raoult said the side effects were trivial things like rash etc. Below is the interview with Dr. Oz talking about his discussion with Dr. Raoul.  The video starts at 21:42 minutes.  This is an updated video. Thanks to one of our readers who brought this to our attention. Theresa May has admitted the Government’s social security experts were not consulted before a controversial decision to deny disability benefits to 160,000 vulnerable people. The Social Security Advisory Committee SSAC was only informed of the changes to Personal Independence Payments PIP “on the day they were being introduced”, MPs were told. The admission was described as “outrageous”, as the row dominated Prime Minister’s Questions and led Jeremy Corbyn to brand the Conservatives “the nasty party” again. Meanwhile, The Independent can reveal that the SSAC will now consider the new PIP regulations at a meeting next Wednesday. It raises the prospect of the committee criticising the decision before MPs vote on it, with a threatened Tory revolt – which must happen before 16 March. The Government is introducing emergency legislation to tighten the criteria for PIP, after a tribunal ruled they should also cover conditions including epilepsy, diabetes and dementia. The ruling would cost at least £3.7bn over the next five years, money which should go to “really disabled people who need it”, one minister said – before later apologising.

Read our privacy notice But one Conservative backbencher has warned the Prime Minister of a growing revolt, urging her to “honour” the verdict delivered by the tribunal. In the Commons, the Labour leader said: “This is a shameful decision that will affect people with dementia, those suffering cognitive disorders due to stroke, military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and those with schizophrenia.” He urged Ms May to “think again” – raising the SSAC, which normally consulted on proposed changes “before the regulations are laid in Parliament”. In reply, the Prime Minister insisted no one currently receiving PIP would “see a reduction in their benefits”. She told MPs: “What the court said is the regulations were unclear – that is why we’re clarifying the regulations and we’re ensuring they reflect the original intention that was agreed by this Parliament.” And she added: “The Work and Pensions Secretary called the chairman of the Social Security Advisory Committee and spoke to him about the regulations on the day they were being introduced.” Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said later: “Given that these changes will impact over 150,000 disabled people, it is outrageous that the Government did not allow these changes to be considered by the Social Security Committee.” A DWP spokeswoman said it was allowed to bypass the SSAC when announcing new regulations if the decision was a “matter of urgency”. And she argued that was the case with the PIP ruling, which “threatened to undermine the consistency of assessments and create confusion” – although it was made in December. The Independent understands the last time the SSAC was not consulted on a welfare measure was in the previous parliament, over cuts to migrant benefits. Mr Corbyn also attacked the comments by George Freeman, the head of the Downing Street policy unit, noting that Ms May, in 2002, described the Tories as the “nasty party”. “Her policy chair suggested people with debilitating conditions were those who, and I quote, ‘take pills at home, who suffer from anxiety and were not really disabled’. Isn’t that proof the nasty party is still around?” he asked. But Ms May said she hoped MPs would accept Mr Freeman’s apology, issued earlier this week. The tribunal also said that claimants who needed support to take medication should be assessed in the same way as those managing therapies such as dialysis at home.",other
97b3e15c,"Gov’t Seeks to Control ‘Disorderly’ Internet Providers With National Gateway Denying 2000 years of the Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age on every continent Here we go again. For five or so years believers didn’t really mention the Medieval Warm Period. Too bruised by the embarrassment of Hockey Stick Zombie failures. But it’s an inconvenient era they have to rub out because none of the expert models can explain what caused it, and it’s hard to panic about same temperatures that Edward the Confessor survived with oxen and carts. And it’s hard to call the modern warmth “man-made” if nature created something just like it 1,000 years ago. By Michael Collett, ABC, Environmental Copy and Paste Promoter Climate scientists writing in the journal Nature have found there is no evidence for “globally coherent warm and cold periods” over the past 2,000 years prior to industrialisation. That’s significant, because climate change deniers have sometimes pointed to epochs like the so-called “Little Ice Age” or “Medieval Warm Period” to argue that the current global warming is one among multiple similar global climate events. But what the research actually shows is that other “peak warming and cooling events” over the past two millennia appear to have been localised, whereas the human-caused global warming observed over the past 150 years is unparalleled in its global scale (not to mention its absolute temperatures). Who’s denying a million raw data points? This new global temperature reconstruction by The Pages Consortium miraculously agrees with the models yet disagrees with hundreds of stalagmites, corals, ice cores, trees, lake sediments, mud from the ocean floor, pollen dust and 6,000 boreholes. It disagrees with the history of peoples like the Vikings. It disagrees with plants that grew and with trees that survived “above the snowline” that shouldn’t. This map shows just some temperature estimates from all around the world during medieval times relative to today. Many of these papers come from Craig Idso at CO2Science.org who maintains the Medieval Warm Period Project. Back in 2009 when I did this map for the Skeptics Handbook II it was a first. Even then, there were already 442 separate research institutes from 41 countries which had published papers showing the MWP.* Also thanks to Luning and Vahrenholt, and the team at NoTricksZone. The latest paper is trying to claim that all these temperatures were not recorded at the same time and that it wasn’t global. But when proxies are combined it’s obvious it was. Even in our modern warm period, there are still warm and cold records being set at the same time. Medieval times were no different. It’s only by collating and combining many proxies that we can see “the average”. 18 proxies tell us the world was the same or warmer 1,000 years ago Craig Loehle in 2008 used 18 non-tree-ring proxies which included Greenland borehole data, Conroy lake pollen, isotopes from Chesapeake Bay, Sargasso Sea, Caribbean Sea, results from caves in South Africa, the Swiss Alps, Sea Surface reconstructions from Norway, the northern Pacific and the South Atlantic and other proxies too. Temperatures were higher 1000 years ago, and cooler 300 years ago. We started warming long before cars and powerstations were invented. There’s little correlation with CO2 levels. Here’s what 120 proxies from the Northern Hemisphere tell us Ljungqvist et al combined 120 proxies of all different kinds and found this pattern for the last 12 centuries across the Northern Hemisphere. Then there’s Christiansen et al 2012 who followed 32 proxies from the Northern Hemisphere back to the year 0 AD. Here’s the Medieval Warm Period in China Here’s the Medieval Warm Period in Antarctica, and the Little Ice Age: Just in case you thought there wasn’t enough from the Southern Hemisphere. Rosenthal et al 2013 put out quite the zinger of a paper. They’ve reconstructed the temperature of the water flowing out of the Pacific to the Indian Ocean over the last 10,000 years and as deep as 900m. The Indonesian Throughflow is pretty significant in global ocean currents. Clearly that water was warmer 1000 years ago than it was circa 1970. It was even warmer again in the Holocene. 3000 hot and cold years in a South African cave South African Cave last 3000 years Source: Holmgren 2001. See also here and here in African reconstructions. The Southern Ocean 7000 year record also shows long term cooling as well as the Roman Warm Period. Then there’s 10,000 mostly hotter years in Greenland No paleoclimate discussion is complete without GISP: 6,000 Boreholes show it was global Just some of the places these boreholes have been dug. They stick a thermometer down a hole, and all over the world there is a pattern that repeats as temperature changes on the surface travel gradually down through the rocks. Sure, the resolution is bare bones. The data is “smoothed”. We can’t use boreholes to know if things were warmer than today and we can’t tell how long ago that big last surge in warmth was, but where boreholes come into their own is in showing us just how global that last big warm spell was. Below is the latest iteration of a graph that went through a savage evolution from 1997 – 2008. What stayed constant was that boreholes always showed a medieval warm period and a little ice age, that is, except for the time Huang et al “lost” nearly 20,000 years of data. In the graph above, if the assumption about the speed of heat flow is shifted to line up the coolest point with other proxies in 1680 and the warmest point to somewhere around 1000 – 1200 the amplitude would increase (see the jaw dropping 1997 original paper which claimed it was much warmer in medieval times). These papers are by no means the only important ones. There are so many others… So go tell the world — everywhere we look the world was hotter and colder in the last 1000 years, the last 10,000 years and the last billion. h/t George, David B, Original Steve, Peter Fitzroy.

Craig Idso divided up studies into three different levels. Level 1 is the most useful, because they are able to tell us, not just whether the world is warming or not, but but also give a number. The level 2 studies just tell us whether things were warmer or cooler at that location, and with a specific timeframe. The level 3 studies are useful for pinpointing the time frame of the warming. All three levels are represented by orange dots. The numbers come from the level 1 studies. I did not put all the positive ones I could find because there were so many, but I included all the negatives I came across. There were 57 studies of a level 1 category (bound to be more now).

5285404b,"Baseball legend Hank Aaron, who received the Moderna COVID vaccine on Jan. 5, has died. According to the New York Times, the Atlanta Braves confirmed the 86-year-old Hall of Famer’s death today, but did not provide further details. CNN reported that Aaron died “peacefully in his sleep,” and that no cause of death was disclosed. Aaron made headlines earlier this month when he was photographed getting the Moderna vaccine. He told the Associated Press at the time that getting vaccinated “makes me feel wonderful.” He added: “I don’t have any qualms about it at all, you know. I feel quite proud of myself for doing something like this. … It’s just a small thing that can help zillions of people in this country.” Aaron was vaccinated at the Morehouse School of Medicine health clinic in Atlanta, in what news reports said was an attempt to inspire other Black Americans to step up to the plate and get the vaccine. The AP reported at the time: “Rolling up their sleeves to take the first of two doses, these octogenarians, their spouses and several other civil rights leaders who received the shots in a brand-new health clinic at the Morehouse School of Medicine acknowledged the legacy of mistrust that many African Americans have toward medical research, stemming from the infamous Tuskegee experiment in which U.S. health workers left syphilis untreated in Black men without their consent, making them suffer needlessly.” In December, VOX reported on the launch of a global campaign using influencers and celebrities to help overcome “vaccine hesitancy,” stating that it “will be unprecedented” and many institutions will have a role, including government and public health authorities. However, health officials continue to encounter pushback, including from healthcare workers. Adverse events to the COVID vaccine have been reported worldwide. Germany and Norway have reported a combined 43 deaths among elderly people who received the Pfizer vaccine, prompting China health officials to call for the vaccines to be suspended, especially among the elderly. On learning of Aaron’s death, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., chairman and chief legal counsel for Children’s Health Defense, said: “Aaron’s tragic death is part of a wave of suspicious deaths among elderly closely following administration of COVID vaccines.” “Studies show that self-interested pharmaceutical company researchers, physicians, nursing homes and health officials seldom report vaccine injuries. Instead, they dismiss injuries and deaths as ‘unrelated’ to vaccination,” Kennedy said. “Public health advocates worry that the vast majority of injuries and deaths will go unreported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), the notoriously broken voluntary surveillance system run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).” A 2001 HHS study concluded that “fewer than 1% of vaccine injuries” are reported to VAERS. As The Defender reported last week, California was forced to recall a batch of 330,000 Moderna vaccines after a cascade of reported injuries, though now the company says it’s okay to resume administration of that batch. The Defender also covered the story of a 56-year-old Florida doctor who died about two weeks after getting his first dose of Pfizer’s vaccine. His death is under investigation by Florida health officials. In addition, multiple severe allergic reactions have been directly linked to the Pfizer vaccine.

745c07fe,"Boko Haram leader Shekau says he's ready to surrender-Military — Daily Times Nigeria You have been sent here because your child, partner, or friend suggested that you invest your life savings into GameStop stock and you are curious what the fuck is going on. This post is long and thorough and mostly does not discuss memes and the internet until the end, but if you read it you will hopefully understand What Is Happening. What is going on is that GameStop, a company that sells physical copies of video games next to Auntie Anne’s pretzel shops in dying malls, is the most highly traded asset in the United States, a “meme stock,” and currently the primary front in a micro class war. GameStop’s stock price jumped from $4 last summer to $20 at the end of 2020, to $40 two weeks ago. It was worth $100-ish at times on Monday and Tuesday, and as I write this it is worth close to $300. Essentially, many normal-ish people have made a huge bet against gigantic financial institutions and are currently winning. In practice this means we are seeing one of the largest wealth transfers from the financial ruling class to the middle and middle-upper classes in recent memory, so it is, understandably, the only thing anyone is talking about. How did this happen? A bunch of Redditors in the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, led by a person going by DeepFuckingValue, analyzed GameStop stock and concluded that its price was undervalued. They then, over the course of months, identified a weakness in the strategies of several giant hedge funds that had bet many millions of dollars that GameStop would fail. These Redditors purchased huge numbers of GameStop stock at low prices (and then kept buying more as the prices rose), held it, and are currently forcing something known as a “short squeeze” that is driving the price up and is emptying these hedge funds in the process. These Redditors are diamond-handing (holding) their stocks, imploring each other to not be a weak-minded stock seller (paper hands) and are waiting for their messiah Ryan Cohen—the CEO of Chewy.com who invested millions in GameStop last year—to hitch them to his rocket and take them to the moon/sun/Mars (become very rich). Advertisement A few weeks ago I became interested in WallStreetBets. I bought 14 shares of GameStop, knowing that if I put a small amount of money in I would actually pay attention to the subreddit and what people were writing about. I did not expect the stock to become worth any money but now I can afford to fix my broken car. I do not have other stocks outside of my 401k. Elon Musk, random venture capitalists, and Mad Money Jim Cramer are all ancillary characters who have made cameos on this journey, and you've got a lot to catch up on: WHAT IS GAMESTOP: GameStop is the number one physical video game retailer in the United States, which means a lot less than it used to in the 1990s, and also has a bunch of stores internationally. GameStop has been closing stores and losing money over the last few years because of the slow death of retail, caused largely by digital storefronts such as Steam and companies like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo opting to sell digital copies of their titles on their own digital stores. The pandemic has also not been good for GameStop. Even though video game sales are skyrocketing, GameStop is a physical store and had to close many locations to comply with COVID-19 restrictions. Sales fell by a third in the first quarter of 2020. Advertisement This has led many financial forecasters to declare that death is inevitable for GameStop, a prognostication that led big hedge funds and capital firms to “short” GameStop stock. WHAT IS ‘SHORTING’ AND WHO IS DOING IT? “Shorting” is a bet that a company's stock will become less valuable. This is done when an investor sells shares of a stock that they do not own. Essentially, they sell shares of a stock at a certain (high) price in the belief that sometime in the near future the price of that stock will go down. They will then be able to buy the stock at the lower price to “cover” their shorts, “closing” the deal and pocketing the difference between the price they sold at and bought at as profit. This is something that giant hedge funds do all the time, often to the chagrin of CEOs like Elon Musk. Often, by betting against a company short sellers are able to put downward pressure on the stock price. What this means is that a struggling company’s stock price can go down simply because a giant hedge fund invests millions or hundreds of millions of dollars shorting it. The mere act of a hedge fund—which are smarter than everyone else, the thinking goes—betting against a company can start a news cycle where investor-types think a company is going to fail, investors sell or get scared, and the stock price goes down. The short sellers win and make a bunch of money. Advertisement Sometimes, however, short sellers lose. This happens when they bet on a stock price to go down, but it goes up instead. The important thing to remember here is that there is theoretically no limit to how much money a short seller can lose. This is because if a short seller shorts a stock at $20, the stock price can continue to go up and the short seller must, at some point, buy that stock to close its position and fulfill its side of the bargain. If I short one stock at $20 and the price of that stock goes to $1 million, I still at some point have to buy that share to close the deal. In this case I would lose $999,980. In this case, a company called Melvin Capital Management shorted millions of dollars in GameStop stock. Another company called Citron Research shorted some large amount of GameStop stock and has also spent much of the last several months explaining why GameStop is a dogshit company that is going to fail. These are companies that most (normal) people have not heard of but are a big deal in the financial world. These companies (as well as a few others), made risky bets that GameStop stock would continue to go down, allowing them to profit immensely, as they usually do. But not this time. WHAT WENT WRONG FOR MELVIN, CITRON, AND THE SHORT SELLERS, INITIALLY As I mentioned earlier, short sellers at some point have to actually buy shares of the company they’ve shorted in order to close their positions and exit their deal. If they do this when a stock's price is higher than their short, they will lock in their losses. So Citron and Melvin and other short sellers have been playing a fabulously expensive game of chicken. Because for the last few months, GameStop stock has slowly been increasing in price. Advertisement The bullish case for GameStop is predicated on the fact that it had a good earnings report earlier this month (its digital sales were up 309 percent), and also saw a big investment from a guy named Ryan Cohen, who is the cofounder of the online pet store Chewy. Chewy is a very successful company and Cohen is seen as a very competent person. Cohen revealed a nearly 10 percent stake in GameStop in September of last year, and upped his stake to nearly 13 percent in December. His investment eventually led to him joining GameStop’s board of directors with ideas like pushing digital sales in tow, which drove investor confidence in the company (because of his prior successes), and pushed the stock price up. It also drove positive media coverage, which, sometimes, can also drive stock prices up. With GME stock prices going up, Melvin, Citron, and short sellers have been waiting for a price crash to cover their positions that has never come. Advertisement The most important thing (as I understand it, at least), and a situation that happens only very rarely, is that short sellers shorted more shares of GameStop than actually exist. What this means is that even if every single short seller wanted to cut their losses and close their positions, they would be unable to do so because the shares don’t exist. Normally this isn’t that much of a problem because over time they’d be able to buy enough stock to close their positions due to people buying and selling stock back and forth. In this case, however, Redditors noticed what was going on and have royally fucked short sellers. Crucially, Redditors on WallStreetBets are holding their stocks Because people haven’t been selling the stock, and because it’s continued to go up, short sellers have been unable to cover their shorts without locking in billions in losses and are unable to cover their shorts entirely because the stock has been over shorted. Here is where things get truly complicated and beyond the scope of this blog. Essentially, you (meaning you, the average person) can buy shares at the market price, no problem. But short sellers want to see a sell-off frenzy, where prices plummet and they can buy huge numbers of shares to reduce their losses or, ideally, lock in their gains. Big short sellers needs to quite literally buy hundreds of thousands or millions of shares, and so they are left waiting for a selling frenzy that may never arrive, or won't come until GameStop has become worth many hundreds or thousands of dollars per share. Advertisement Anyways, this brings us to Reddit and WallStreetBets. WHAT IS WALLSTREETBETS This is what WallStreetBets looks like on Reddit: And this is what it looks like on Discord: And this is what it sounds like: r/WallStreetBets is a subreddit that describes itself as “4chan with a Bloomberg Terminal,” which is the laziest but probably most apt way to think of it. It is a subreddit for people who like to gamble on the stock market that has its own culture, terminology, characters, and villains. It's also very toxic, similar to 4chan. You can broadly think of WallStreetBets as a bunch of investors who think that it is very boring to take a small portion of your paycheck and invest it in your 401k and wait to get old to be rich. It is full of day traders without a ton of money who YOLO their money into a single stock (invest their life savings, or their mom’s life savings, or their student loan payments, or their paychecks), to hopefully realize a giant profit in a short period of time by taking advantage of temporary price movements. Historically, the top posts in this subreddit are “loss porn” and “gain porn,” which are screenshots of people’s investment portfolios showing how they turned a small amount of money into a huge amount of money in a short period of time, or turned a huge amount of money into a tiny amount of money in a short period of time. The broader financial investment world thinks these people are morons and degenerates, and the prevailing financial wisdom is that investing a significant amount of money into specific companies' stocks (versus index funds that mirror the entire market or an entire market sector) is very risky and best left to pros and People Who Know Better, such as giant hedge funds and billionaires. This is the type of advice that financial advisors and podcasters have to give because “take a cash advance on your credit card and invest it all into a stock symbol that you picked randomly from a Ouija board” is not defensible and not advisable to the public at large. Advertisement All of that said, the stock market has been increasingly unmoored from the actual economy, with the stock market as a whole skyrocketing in price over the last 24 months even as hundreds of thousands of people die from a pandemic, millions of people lose their jobs, and billionaires get richer while the rest of us get poorer. Picking random stocks and investing money into them has been a legitimately successful strategy for many people over this short time sample period. It surely will not last. But nonetheless it is working. WALLSTREETBETS AND GAMESTOP In September 2019, a redditor named DeepFuckingValue posted a screenshot of himself investing $53,000 into GameStop stock over the preceding few months, at prices of between 30 cents and 75 cents per share. On that day, his shares were worth $113,000, a gain of 86 percent. GameStop stock was worth 85 cents at the time. This post didn’t take off, but over the months, DeepFuckingValue, who goes by the name RoaringKitty on YouTube, continued to post updates on their GameStop YOLO. On YouTube, they laid out their case for why they invested in GameStop, which largely came down to GameStop’s strong online sales, the fact that it was closing stores (reducing costs) and that its per-store revenue was increasing as it did so. Advertisement Other redditors and DeepFuckingValue eventually caught on that something else was happening with GameStop stock: It was the most shorted stock in the entire stock market. That, combined with what DeepFuckingValue described as “strong fundamentals,” suggested that, at some point, these short sellers would be forced to close their positions. The opportunity, as I mentioned earlier, is that short sellers overextended themselves and would only be able to close their positions: A) at a loss and B) if suddenly a bunch of people who own GameStop stock sold their stock, which would drive it down. WallStreetBets at the time had more than a million subscribers, and DeepFuckingValue's gain porn was going viral on the subreddit back in December, when the stock prices were around $4. His gains led more people to invest in GameStop, further driving the price up. People began to write treatises on why they believed GameStop was a good investment, leading to more investing. All of this put more pressure on short sellers, which helped snowball the stock up, leading to unrealized gains for all. The rallying cry of the entirety of the WallStreetBets subreddit and its extraordinarily chaotic Discord became: buy GameStop stock, hold it, and fuck over the big hedge funds, specifically Melvin Capital and Citron Research, which, throughout this entire saga, was publishing various YouTube videos about why it believed GameStop stock would go down. Advertisement This created a trollish us-versus-them mentality. If you bought GameStop stock, you are cool and going to become rich. If you sell GameStop stock before you ride its rocket to Mars, you are a coward and are only helping these big hedge funds and fucking over your fellow Redditor. All throughout this, DeepFuckingValue's account went from $50k, to $100k, to several million, to $10 million, to $20 million. DeepFuckingValue did not sell their stock, as far as we know—if they could be brave enough to hold then, you, a lowly investor, could afford to also hold your stock, further driving the price up as Melvin and The Establishment began to sweat. WHY THE STOCK HAS GONE COMPLETELY BANANAS This brings us to this week. By all accounts, Melvin Capital is in deep trouble. Earlier this week, it took in $2.75 billion in funding, reportedly to help cover its GameStop shorts. A prominent venture capitalist said he was buying GameStop stock. Every financial publisher is talking about GameStop stock. Elon Musk, who, again, famously hates Tesla's short sellers with a burning passion, tweeted about GameStop stock and said that he's hanging out in the WallStreetBets Discord. Meanwhile, the GameStop shorts have seemingly not figured out an elegant way out of this. Many prognosticators and analysts on WallStreetBets have been writing posts explaining why they believe GameStop stock will go over $1,000 or $5,000 per share, which involves a scenario where banks and investment platforms themselves require short sellers to cover their shorts all at once, which will make the stock go even crazier than it already has. This seems to be the prevailing wisdom among GME investors at the moment—the stock is worth $350 as I write this, but most people on the subreddit seem unsatisfied. They are out to make a life-changing amount of money and they are out for hedge fund blood. Advertisement IS THIS ILLEGAL / WHO IS GOING TO JAIL? Probably no one is going to jail, but some hedge funds will likely go bankrupt. WallStreetBets is not “manipulating” the market, really. People are posting publicly-available information and their own analyses of what they believe a stock will do, and hundreds of thousands or millions of people are reading that analysis and acting on their own. They are largely doing what stock prognosticators do all day every day on TV shows about stocks. WHAT ABOUT NOKIA, BEST BUY, BLACKBERRY, AMC, ETC WallStreetBets is also investing heavily in Nokia, Best Buy, Blackberry, AMC Theaters, and other stocks. I am not a financial expert and don’t know what will happen with these but in the short term these stocks have also seen large gains (but smaller than GameStop). All of them have been shorted, but not shorted as heavily as GameStop. WHAT THIS ALL MEANS The financial press is trying to explain what this means for them, hedge funds, capitalism, the economy, and the stock market moving forward. Internet culture reporters are trying to explain if this is GOOD or BAD, if this is the Donald Trump-ification of the stock market, where a meme or troll gets out of control and causes unprecedented havoc on the real world. Anthony Scaramucci, of all people, is calling this the French Revolution of finance. It is true that this means something and that this is likely a big moment. We are seeing, I think, the democratization of financial information, at least to some extent. While we've seen technology like deepfakes and facial recognition filter down from research firms and big companies into the hands of ordinary people and amateur technologists who then use them for whatever purposes they want, we are seeing financial technologies, information, and analysis becoming available not just to hedge fund managers, financial institutions, and the very rich, but to the masses. It is clear that there is a sect of WallStreetBets who either previously or currently work in the financial sector who are fed up with increasing inequality, are tired of watching giant corporations repeatedly fuck over ordinary people, and are explaining how it all works to huge groups of people. What they are doing is risky, but it's not very stupid. We have been told for decades that the banks and the people who work at Goldman Sachs and Fidelity and hedge funds none of us have ever heard of are smarter than us, that they deserve to be rich, that they should be the ones who pull the levers on the economy, that they should decide which companies are good and which are bad, that they should be the ones who help make financial regulations. All along the way they have gotten fabulously wealthy and we have been stuck with stagnant wages, record consumer debt, and financial advice that tells us to wait until we are old to retire. WallStreetBets says this is a new paradigm where the masses have the power and hedge funds are scared. A top post on the subreddit this morning was called this: FOR ALL THE BIG FUCKING HEDGE FUNDS MONITORING US, THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM US TO YOU, WE FUCKING OWN YOU NOW, FUCK. YOU. It's unclear how far this will go. After all, people with thousands of dollars to invest in GameStop still have thousands of dollars to invest with, unlike the millions of people in the U.S. currently out of work due to a deadly pandemic. The free investment app of choice, Robinhood, was also just fined by the SEC for hosing its own customers by seeking favorable rebates instead of the best prices for its users. And even if some hedge funds are getting bodied by retail investors, the massive funds such as Fidelity and Blackrock that own tens of millions of GameStop shares are probably just as happy.",other
3971d0e8,"Ex-ambassador McFaul switches to Russian to celebrate midterm victory over…Putin HOUSTON — In the weeks since President Obama’s re-election, Republicans around the country have been wondering how to proceed. Some conservatives in Texas have been asking a far more pointed question: how to secede. Secession fever has struck parts of Texas, which Mitt Romney won by nearly 1.3 million votes. Sales of bumper stickers reading “Secede” — one for $2, or three for $5 — have increased at TexasSecede.com. In East Texas, a Republican official sent out an e-mail newsletter saying it was time for Texas and Vermont to each “go her own way in peace” and sign a free-trade agreement among the states. A petition calling for secession that was filed by a Texas man on a White House Web site has received tens of thousands of signatures, and the Obama administration must now issue a response. And Larry Scott Kilgore, a perennial Republican candidate from Arlington, a Dallas suburb, announced that he was running for governor in 2014 and would legally change his name to Larry Secede Kilgore, with Secede in capital letters. As his Web page, secedekilgore.com, puts it: “Secession! All other issues can be dealt with later.” In Texas, talk of secession in recent years has steadily shifted to the center from the fringe right. It has emerged as an echo of the state Republican leadership’s anti-Washington, pro-Texas-sovereignty mantra on a variety of issues, including health care and environmental regulations. For some Texans, the renewed interest in the subject serves simply as comic relief after a crushing election defeat.",fake

Athletes narrate and feature in self-filmed content in a film released on this landmark date. They will also hold live chats and take over @Olympics social handles between 4 and 20 February, the period during which next year’s Games will take place. Welcoming athletes from around the world, IOC President Thomas Bach today formally invited the National Olympic Committees NOC of the world and their winter sports athletes to participate in next year’s Games. Respecting the spirit that the Games are a sporting event, it is the IOC President who invites the NOCs to the Olympic Games. Given the current circumstances, this was done today from Olympic House in Lausanne, Switzerland. The IOC President symbolically signed and sent invitations to eight NOCs, including the Chinese Olympic Committee. The other seven NOCs were the Hellenic Olympic Committee, which is located in the country in which the Olympic Games originated; the NOCs from future Olympic Games host cities – the Japanese Olympic Committee for Tokyo 2020; the Comité National Olympique et Sportif Français for Paris 2024; the Comitato Olimpico Nazionale Italiano for Milano Cortina 2026, the successor of Beijing; and the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee for LA28 – as well as the Australian Olympic Committee and the Nigerian Olympic Committee, which sent the largest delegations from Oceania and Africa respectively to the last Olympic Winter Games. All eight NOCs accepted the invitation via a video message. Speaking about this milestone, Bach said: “One year from now, Beijing will write history as the first city ever to host both the summer and winter editions of the Olympic Games. These Games will connect the Chinese people with the world.” He continued: “Having seen how China is overcoming the coronavirus crisis, we are very confident that our Chinese hosts will ensure safe and secure Olympic Games in full cooperation with the IOC. Every time that I have visited China, I am so impressed by the enthusiasm and support for the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022. This is why, we can say already now with great confidence: China is ready. Ready to welcome the world’s best winter sports athletes for unforgettable Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022. We all are looking forward to this global celebration of sport.” The digitally-led #StrongerTogether campaign focuses on athletes around the world and their solidarity and progress towards the Games. As part of this, the IOC has published the #StrongerTogether film, which showcases athletes’ preparations for next year’s Games, distributed globally across digital, social and partner media channels. Narrated by Chinese freestyle skier Eileen Gu, it features iconic moments of past Olympic Winter Games, a glimpse of Beijing 2022’s venues, and self-filmed content from athletes’ preparations, as they get ready to go to Beijing 2022. A number of digital partnerships will boost interest in this milestone. Twitter will run a unique emoji feature when users tweet @Olympics with #StrongerTogether and the ❄️ emoji; while a special Beijing 2022 filter will be available on Snapchat. Iconic winter Olympic moments will be released daily on the Olympic Channel and @Olympics Twitter, and there will be athlete takeovers and inspirational talks on the Olympics Instagram. The IOC’s Worldwide Olympic Partners and Rights-Holding Broadcasters will also be activating this landmark over the coming days. Some of the notable activities being organised include the unveiling of a physical countdown clock in Beijing by OMEGA, the Official Timekeeper of the Olympic Games. In addition, fans will be able to interact live with winter athletes, some on their road to Beijing 2022, through the Olympian and Paralympian Online Experiences launched with Worldwide Olympic and Paralympic Partner Airbnb. Omega In China, a One Year to Go celebration show was broadcast on national television. In addition to celebrating this special milestone with a cultural spectacular, the Beijing 2022 Organising Committee also unveiled the official Beijing 2022 torch design.

All competition venues were completed by the end of 2020, with the remaining renovations and construction to be finished by the end of this year. With the aim of getting 300 million people engaged in winter sports and having received around one million applications for volunteer positions, the Beijing 2022 Games will be transformative for both China and the global winter sports scene. There will be winter sports before the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 and a new era of winter sports afterwards. This can already be seen from the numbers. Five years ago, there were only 460 ski resorts in China. This number grew to 644 by the end of 2019. The Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 will also have a strong emphasis on sustainability. All venues will be powered by 100 per cent renewable energy, while natural, low-carbon-emission CO 2 refrigeration systems will be used at most of the Beijing 2022 ice venues – the first time this low climate impact technology will be used in China and at the Olympic Winter Games. Furthermore, 7 out of the 12 competition and non-competition venues within the Beijing 2022 competition zone will be legacy venues from Beijing 2008. Beijing will host the XXIV Olympic Winter Games from 4 to 20 February 2022. ### The International Olympic Committee is a not-for-profit, civil, non-governmental, international organisation made up of volunteers which is committed to building a better world through sport. It redistributes more than 90 per cent of its income to the wider sporting movement, which means that every day the equivalent of USD 3.4 million goes to help athletes and sports organisations at all levels around the world. ### For more information, please contact the IOC Media Relations Team: Tel: +41 21 621 6000, email: pressoffice@olympic.org, or visit our web site at www.olympic.org.

One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. During the IG’s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI’s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine’s Day. “We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,” Governor Scott said. According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel’s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn’t the sole reason why he is being removed. The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week. Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting. It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL. Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy. In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying. Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates. Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?” The tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike who quipped that the Broward Sheriff’s office should use the funds to pay for better officer training, not new cars. Leaders on both sides of the aisle have called for Sheriff Israel to resign or be removed by the Governor for his extreme dereliction of duty and failure to prevent one of the worst schools shootings in US history. During the Florida GOP Primary debate in Florida last week, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Rep. Ron DeSantis were asked about the Parkland school shooting. Both Putnam and DeSantis called for the removal of Scott Israel while asserting their support of the Second Amendment. “I would have removed that sheriff from Broward County. He failed his citizens and he should have been removed,” DeSantis said. “Sheriff Israel is under investigation and he needs to go,” Putnam said. Governor Scott is expected to release a statement in the coming week when Sheriff Israel is removed from office. Scott is currently running for US Senate in Florida, and news of Sheriff Israel’s removal is sure to boost his approval rating in what is gearing up to be one of the most important Senate races in the country. In the days following the Parkland shooting, Sheriff Scott Israel was confronted and asked about his support of and affiliation with the Democratic Party and why he chose to blame guns instead of holding his department and the FBI accountable. Unable to withstand tough questioning, Sheriff Israel became flustered and ended the interview after saying, “the only person accountable for this killing is the detestable, cowardly, murderer. He is solely responsible for this horrific act.” However, as the investigation into Parkland has shown, both Sheriff Israel and the FBI dropped the ball and are to blame for their failure to prevent the shooting despite receiving multiple warning signs.",fake
b9ccbcb4,"New Eavesdropping Equipment Sucks All Data Off Your Phone Though health officials have warned Americans to prepare for the spread of the novel coronavirus in the U.S., people shouldn’t wear face masks to prevent the spread of the infectious illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. surgeon general. But that’s not the only reason Americans may want to think twice about using masks, one expert told MarketWatch. Most people don’t know how to use face masks correctly, and a rush to buy masks could prevent the people who need them most — health care providers — from getting them, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a scholar at the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In fact the U.S. surgeon general recently urged the public to “STOP BUYING MASKS!” “They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!,” wrote Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Twitter US:TWTR The CDC said last month it doesn’t recommend people use face masks, making the announcement on the same day that first case of person-to-person transmission of coronavirus was reported in the U.S. The CDC recommendation on masks stands, a spokesman told MarketWatch Wednesday, even with the first reported case of a COVID-19 infection in an individual in California who had not been to China or been exposed to a person diagnosed with the virus. “The virus is not spreading in the general community,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the Center for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a Jan. 30 briefing. “We don’t routinely recommend the use of face masks by the public to prevent respiratory illness. And we certainly are not recommending that at this time for this new virus.” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said Tuesday, “Our advice remains as it has been that the average American does not need a N95 mask. These are really more for health care providers.” N95 masks are tighter-fitting than surgical masks and protect against small particles and large droplets, according to the CDC. Azar said that there are only 30 million N95 masks in the national stockpile, adding that there are “as many as 300 million masks needed in the U.S. for health care workers.” There were 86 cases of COVID-19 and two reported deaths in the U.S., as of Monday. See also: Alpha Pro Tech’s stock rockets as coronavirus outbreak leads to a big spike in face mask orders Americans don't seem to be heeding health officials’ advice: Walgreens US:WBA and Duane Reade pharmacies have seen increased demand for face masks and hand sanitizer across the country, said Alexandra Brown, a spokeswoman for Walgreens, which owns both chains. “We continually and closely monitor these types of situations to ensure that we have sufficient supply of those products,” she said. Several sites have sold out of face masks entirely. Target’s US:TGT brand of face masks, priced at $5.99 for a 10-pack, were out of stock on its site as of Thursday. A Target spokeswoman declined to comment on when the face masks would be back in stock. There were still some face masks available on Amazon US:AMZN last Thursday, though many were quickly becoming out of stock. A pack of 20 3M US:MMM face masks was available for $129 on Thursday morning, but by midday it had sold out. In April last year the same pack of masks cost $9.99, according to camelcamelcamel.com, a site that tracks historic prices of goods sold on Amazon. Amazon and 3M did not respond to requests for comment on when customers could expect to purchase masks that are currently out of stock. To protect against a mask shortage, Home Depot US:HD US:HD US:HD US:HD US:HD has “limited purchase quantity to 10 [masks] per person to best serve as many customers as possible,” said Margaret Smith, a Home Depot spokeswoman. “Our merchandising and supply chain teams are working hard to replenish these items as quickly as possible.” CVS US:CVS has also seen a surge in sales of face masks. The demand “may cause shortages at some store locations and we’ll re-supply those stores as quickly as possible,” Stephanie Cunha, a CVS spokeswoman, said last month. Adalja applauded the CDC’s recommendation on face masks. “Even during H1N1 [flu epidemic], there was no recommendation to wear face masks,” he said. They “end up creating a false sense of security and most people don’t wear them appropriately,” he said. People who are not in the medical field who wear the masks often come in contact with germs when they lift the mask up to eat or slip their fingers under the mask to blow their nose, he said. Panic-driven demand for face masks, Adalja said, is particularly worrisome because it could have “a negative supply shock” effect on hospital personnel who need these masks more than the general public. Like the surgeon general, Adalja said, “the best ways [for the general public] to protect themselves are the basic hygienic measures.” That includes washing your hands regularly and covering sneezes and coughs. But if you are “sick and need to go out you should wear a mask.” Instead of wearing face masks, the general public should “be vigilant to the symptoms and signs of this novel coronavirus, that is, a fever and cough, and if you have those symptoms, please call your health-care provider,” Messonnier said last month. “We want our actions to be evidence-based and appropriate to the current circumstance,” she said, which she said did not justify the use of face masks for people who have not been directly exposed to the virus. The CDC has said it expects to see more coronavirus cases in the U.S. “It’s not so much a question of if … but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness, Messonnier said on Feb. 25. There are still many unknowns about how this strain of coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, spreads, but when person-to-person spread has occurred in the past, “it is thought to have happened via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread,” the CDC said on its website. Like the CDC, the World Health Organization advises people to wear a mask only if they are displaying symptoms of coronavirus or “taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection.” In a separate update last month, the WHO gave instructions for how to appropriately wear and dispose of face masks. WHO also noted, “However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide the adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be adopted.” WHO advises people who wish to wear a mask to place the mask “carefully to cover mouth and nose and tie securely to minimise any gaps between the face and the mask,” avoid touching the mask while you’re wearing it, and dispose of masks as soon as they become damp or humid. When removing the face mask, WHO recommends that people “do not touch the front but remove the lace from behind.” Worldwide, 89,197 people have been infected with COVID-19, and at least 3,048 have died as of Monday.

ALVIN JAEGER, NORTH DAKOTA SECRETARY OF STATE ON APPLICATION TO VACATE STAY January 11, 2017 WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.) today urged Senate Democrats to work with Republicans to repeal Obamacare and clear the way for solutions that will expand access to quality, affordable health care for all Americans. A vote on legislation that provides Congress the tools to repeal Obamacare is expected in the Senate later today. “Democrats have failed to live up to nearly every promise they made when they forced Obamacare through Congress without a single Republican vote,” Blunt said. “Despite all of their claims to the contrary, this law has forced millions of Americans off the plans and doctors they liked and could afford, drastically driven up premiums and deductibles, and slashed the number of health plan options available to families.” This year, 97 Missouri counties have only one insurer participating in the Obamacare exchanges. Last year, every Missouri county had at least two insurance options. In addition, most Missourians will see an increase in their premiums, with some facing an increase upward of 40 percent. Blunt continued, “Now is the time for Senate Democrats to start making things right. They’ll have that opportunity today when the Senate considers a resolution that gives Congress the tools to repeal Obamacare and pave the way for solutions that will expand access to quality, affordable health care. By taking this first step toward repealing Obamacare, Republicans are keeping the promises we made to the American people. I urge all of my Democrat colleagues to do the same.”",partial

The World Health Organisation is to list processed meat among the most cancer-causing substances, alongside arsenic and asbestos. Fresh red meat is also due to join the ‘encyclopaedia of carcinogens’ and is likely to be ranked as only slightly less dangerous than the preserved products. Scroll down for video The World Health Organisation is to list processed meat among the most cancer-causing substances, alongside arsenic and asbestos The rulings, revealed to the Mail by a well-placed source, will send shock waves through the farming industry and the fast food sector. They could also lead to new dietary guidelines and warning labels on packs of bacon. The classifications, by the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer, come amid mounting concern that meat fuels the disease which claims more than 150,000 lives a year in the UK. Links to bowel cancer, Britain’s second biggest cancer killer, are particularly strong, with estimations that half of cases could be prevented by healthier lifestyles. The Department of Health’s scientific advisers recently concluded that red and processed meat ‘probably’ increase the odds of bowel cancer. But the WHO is expected to go further by saying processed meat causes cancer. The decision, due on Monday, follows a meeting of scientists from ten nations, including the UK, who reviewed all available evidence. Smoking: Scientists are believed to have agreed processed meat is ‘carcinogenic to humans’, the highest of five possible rankings, shared with alcohol, asbestos, arsenic and cigarettes They are believed to have agreed processed meat is ‘carcinogenic to humans’, the highest of five possible rankings, shared with alcohol, asbestos, arsenic and cigarettes. Risks and benefits must be considered together before telling people what to eat, drink, drive, breathe, or where to work Barry Carpenter, president of the North American Meat Institute Processed meat is made by smoking, curing, salting, or adding chemicals. Examples are ham, bacon, pastrami and salami, as well as hot dogs and some sausages. Burgers are also expected to be included. Red meat is expected to be one rung below, ‘probably carcinogenic to humans’. Meat in general contains high concentrations of fat and it is thought the compound that gives meat its red colour may damage the bowel lining. Processed meat has previously been blamed for one in 30 deaths and is seen as dangerous because preserving techniques can raise levels of cancer-causing chemicals. It is estimated that if intake was cut to 20g a day – a rasher of bacon a day or an English breakfast once a week – almost 20,000 early deaths would be prevented in the UK each year. Ruling: The World Health Organisation is to list processed meat among the most cancer-causing substances, alongside arsenic and asbesto Any advice to cut, or avoid, processed meat will be welcomed by cancer charities. But it could have huge repercussions for the meat industry, which will be mindful that sugar sales fell last year after the WHO issued a warning on overconsumption. The beef sector makes £2.8billion for the economy and provides 440,000 jobs in England. The North American Meat Institute NAMI said the report defied 'both common sense and dozens of studies showing no correlation between meat and cancer'. 'Red and processed meat are among 940 substances reviewed by International Agency for Research IARC on found to pose some level of theoretical 'hazard,' said Barry Carpenter, president of NAMI. 'IARC says you can enjoy your yoga class, but don’t breathe air Class I carcinogen, sit near a sun-filled window Class I, drink wine or coffee Class I and Class 2A,, eat grilled food Class 2A, or apply aloe vera Class 2B. 'Risks and benefits must be considered together before telling people what to eat, drink, drive, breathe, or where to work.' The industry says red meat is rich in protein, a good source of vitamins, iron and zinc, and a key part of a balanced diet. Professor Richard Knox, a former Institute of Cancer Research expert, said ‘most cancer deaths will not be due to bowel cancer and even fewer linked to meat consumption’. Government guidelines on red meat, given in 2011, recommend adults eat no more than 70g a day.",fake

Speaking to Russia’s top military brass after watching the live feed of the launch of the Avangard vehicle from the Defense Ministry’s control room, Putin said the successful test was a “great success” and an “excellent New Year’s gift to the nation.” The test comes amid bitter tensions in Russia-U.S. relations, which have sunk to their lowest level since the Cold War times over the conflict in Ukraine, the war in Syria and the allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Putin's hopes for repairing ties with Washington under President Donald Trump have fizzled amid investigations into allegations of Trump's campaign ties with Russia, and tensions have escalated as the U.S. administration slapped Russia with new waves of sanctions. The Avangard was among the array of new nuclear weapons that Putin presented in March, saying that Russia had to develop them in response to the development of the U.S. missile defense system that could erode Russia’s nuclear deterrent.

Hammer USF Executive Director NRA Past President Many folks remember that during the fight to pass Florida's Concealed Carry law, the Florida Sheriffs Association opposed concealed carry. They literally said they didn't like hidden guns. At the time, open carry was legal in Florida and had been for decades. They said if people were going to be allowed to carry guns, they needed to carry them openly so law enforcement officers could see them and know who had guns -- they claimed it was a matter of officer safety. Now, they have reversed positions. They claim concealed carry is fine and they don't mind concealed guns. BUT, open carry is dangerous. They claim they won't know the good guys from the bad guys, and one sheriff (now retired) said law enforcement would have to draw down and anybody carrying openly. You've probably heard or read most of the rhetoric. They always lead off saying they are strong Second Amendment supporters then proceed to explain why they OPPOSE Second Amendment rights. The Constitution guarantees your right to keep and bear arms and it certainly doesn't say you can only exercise your rights if your sheriff agrees with it. Below are the facts about open carry -- it is a rebuttal of some the latest claims. You may also click here The Truth About Open Carry to download a copy for the fact sheet to share with others. The Truth About The Open Carry Bill & the 45 States that Allow Open Carry In recent Palm Beach Post Blog articles and a Tampa Bay Times Blog article, the Chairman of the Florida Sheriffs Association's Legislative Committee (FSA) is quoted with some erroneous claims regarding the proposed open carry bill in Florida (SB-300 by Sen. Don Gaetz and HB-163 by Rep. Matt Gaetz). In recent Palm Beach Post Blog articles and a Tampa Bay Times Blog article, the Chairman of the Florida Sheriffs Association's Legislative Committee (FSA) is quoted with some erroneous claims regarding the proposed open carry bill in Florida (SB-300 by Sen. Don Gaetz and HB-163 by Rep. Matt Gaetz). Below are some of those claims and our responses. FSA CLAIM: The bill as currently drafted is extremely broad, lacking limits on when, how or where firearms could be carried. FACT: The same provisions and restrictions that apply to concealed carry also apply to open carry (s.790.06). Only a person with a license to carry concealed will be able to carry openly. Additionally, the improper exhibition of firearms law (s.790.10) applies whether carrying concealed or openly. Further, because of these and other erroneous claims, a clarification amendment, to stop open carry opponents from continuing to make such false claims, was added to the bill in Senate Criminal Justice Committee the morning of 10/20/15 – We know the spokesman made that claim even AFTER the clarification amendment was added because the spokesman made reference to an amendment that didn't pass in the same committee meeting. Since the FSA spokesman obviously doesn't want to believe the NRA's data, the following data was provided by Florida Carry, Inc. – and their data confirms ours. FSA CLAIM: The bill's proponents claim that 45 other states already allow open-carry. But that's not really accurate. FACT: To the contrary, it is accurate. Forty-five (45) states allow open carry of firearms. Varying restrictions on open carry in some states does not alter the fact that 45 states allow open carry. 15 of 45 open carry states require a license to carry concealed or openly. 30 of 45 open carry states do not require any license to carry openly 0 of 15 of the concealed carry license states require additional training to carry openly 0 of 45 states offer a separate open carry license 2 of 45 states require an open carry holster. On 1/1/16 Texas will require a holster. 0 of 45 states require a retention holster. 5 of 15 are may-issue states where law enforcement issues licenses 15 of 15 states require the license holder to produce the license on lawful demand by a law enforcement officer. FSA CLAIM: ... most open-carry states have strict rules about ... producing the permit on demand. FACT: This is a red herring. FLORIDA law already requires license holders to produce a license on demand by a law enforcement officer. And for the record, all 15 states that require a license, require producing the license on lawful demand by a law enforcement officer. FSA CLAIM: ...[I]t's ‘intellectually dishonest' to say open carry laws are working in the 45 other states because there are so many variations in the laws and the demographics. FACT: The open carry laws are working in 45 states. Opponents have presented no evidence to the contrary – no evidence that it isn't working in any state and no evidence of problems in any state. These are just baseless allegations. Simply because different states have variations in their laws does not in any way alter the fact that open carry is allowed and that it’s working. FSA CLAIM: In Pennsylvania, for example, cities can opt out of its open carry law and some, including Philadelphia, do just that, Gualtieri said. Florida cities don't have the option to opt out of a state law. FACT: Pennsylvania DOES NOT allow cities to opt out of its open carry law. Pennsylvania does not require a license for a person to carry openly. Philadelphia cannot opt out of the state open carry law. Pennsylvania state law allows the city of Philadelphia (and only Philadelphia) to require a license to carry openly in Philadelphia. FSA CLAIM: As for demographics, You can't compare Sioux Falls, S.D. to downtown Miami or downtown Tampa or downtown Orlando, Gualtieri said. FACT: This argument is illogical and perhaps intentionally misleading. Seventy percent (70%) of the American public live in open carry states from all regions of the country. Many of the 45 open carry states have large and diverse cities just like Florida and where you live geographically, whether it's Trilby, FL or Fanning Springs, FL, you have the same constitutional rights as citizens who live in Miami, Tampa, or Orlando. FSA CLAIM: ...the state's trespass law gives businesses the right to ask anyone openly carrying a weapon to leave their property, but they ... will be reluctant to tell a person wearing a .45 to leave. FACT: Posting signs prohibiting open carry inside a business establishment is a simple solution. Proper notification will stop citizens from even entering the establishment. Property owners already must post trespass signs to notify the public to stay off private property. Businesses have the right to refuse service and evict anyone they wish unless it's done on the basis of race, gender, or religion. Further, it is common to see signs that say, No shirt, no shoes - no service. Why are they reluctant to post signs saying, No open carrying of firearms? FSA CLAIM: ..if you are McDonald's you won't be able to exclude somebody from putting their gun on the table and sitting there and eating. FACT: Again, any business may evict a customer for behavior they deem to be offensive, dangerous or inappropriate. Further it is a criminal offense under s.790.10 to exhibit a firearm in a rude or careless manner.",partial
5daad203,"One in four mothers-to-be have mental health issues TALLAHASSEE — As the Florida Legislature finished its historic special session and sent a revamped redistricting map back to the state Supreme Court on Tuesday, another kind of history was being made. Dozens of state House members were voluntarily house hunting, running for a different office, or planning to sit out the next legislative session to avoid a matchup with another lawmaker. Republican James Grant filed papers Tuesday to run in a Pinellas-Hillsborough district that will force him to leave his current Carrollwood home. Rep. Perry Thurston, the incoming Democratic leader, planned to move in with his mom. Republican Eddy Gonzalez planned to rent in the Hialeah neighborhood where he grew up. And Rep. Scott Plakon of Longwood was ready to move in with his adult son a town over. It's historic,'' said Rep. Will Weatherford, the Wesley Chapel Republican and incoming House speaker who led the House's redistricting effort. It's the first time in the nation this many members have been drawn into the same districts where it wasn't a court order. The result, he said: a lot of blood, sweat and tears,'' and a gradual realization that having control of our own destiny and our own maps was more important than anybody's individual political agenda. The House completed the two-week legislative redistricting session Tuesday and voted 61-47 to pass the Senate's revamped map without change. The Florida Supreme Court had rejected the first Senate map for failing to follow the requirements of the new Fair Districts standards. The new proposal, which appears to create more visually compact districts than the first, also creates one less Republican majority seat, giving the GOP a 23-15 statistical advantage, with two swing districts. Democrats maligned the Senate's second map, saying it was fraught with many of the same problems as the first — from protecting incumbents, inexplicably dividing cities and counties and failing to protect minority voting strength. We'll see you in court,'' Florida Democratic Party spokeswoman Brannon Jordan said in a terse statement. Miami-Dade Republicans joined with Democrats in opposing the map, voicing concern that the proposal doesn't create enough Hispanic districts despite huge gains in the population over the last decade. But Weatherford said he considered the Senate map constitutional and warned that rejecting the map would set a very dangerous precedent. Unlike the Senate map, the House's proposed plan was approved by the court on the first review. Weatherford believes that was because legislators were willing to put the process and the chamber above themselves. He recalls telling members after Fair Districts passed in November 2010: There will be political carnage from this. For the next 18 months, every opportunity he had, he said, he would just hammer that home. It conditioned the members and allowed them to come to terms with, early on, the fact that it was going to be a hard process, Weatherford said Tuesday. To ease the transition, Weatherford made a promise to any Republican House member who moved into a new district that he would protect them during the election season. It made the decision a little bit easier for some members,'' said Rep. Carlos Lopez Cantera, the House Republican leader. Still, Grant said the process was very tough. Grant not only grew up in the district he now represents, but he lives 500 yards from his parents' home. He's moving to a redrawn district to the west that includes a majority of his current constituents. The move also means Grant will avoid a primary with Rep. Shawn Harrison, R-Lutz. No one ever expected to me leave Carrollwood,'' Grant said. But he said his father, the former state Sen. John Grant, had seen redistricting tangles before and was adamant that when I ran, I rent, rather than buy. Thurston's move to his mother's home in Lauderhill will avoid a matchup with Rep. Elaine Schwartz, D-Hollywood. It's just two years,'' he said. Anybody can do anything for two years. Rep. Scott Plakon, R-Longwood, will move into a neighboring district with his adult son to avoid being matched up with Rep. Chris Dorworth, R-Lake Mary, who is slated to become House speaker after Weatherford. Only two current legislators — Reps. Jose Felix Diaz and Ana Rivas Logan, both Miami Republicans — don't see moving as an option. They plan to fight it out all summer for the lone seat. I own my house,'' Diaz said Tuesday. If the economy were different, maybe I could move, but it's not an option. Times news artist Darla Cameron contributed to this report.",partial
c4f8a375,"BRAZIL'S health authority has confirmed a volunteer has died after participating in the clinical trials of the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. The country's health authority, Anvisa confirmed one person died in trials. However, it is understood the man took a placebo rather than the vaccine and the health authority confirmed trials will continue. The drug is currently undergoing phase three clinical trials. Brazil has plans in place to purchase the drug and produce it at its biomedical research centre if it clears the final phase of trials. Despite the death of the volunteer, Oxford University has stated there are no concerns surrounding the safety of the trials. The vaccine is seen as one of the leading drugs, with the UK Government signing a deal for 100 million doses. Trials of the drug were also put on hold in the US since September 6 after a volunteer fell ill. Both India and South Africa have resumed clinical trials of the potential vaccine. AstraZeneca has also signed an agreement with Europe's Inclusive Vaccine Alliance. Under this, 400 million doses could be ready to supply European countries who participate in the alliance. The UK has also secured 30 million doses of a separate drug made by BioNtech/Pfizer. Another deal worth 60 million doses, has also been agreed with Valneva - in total there are six vaccines under consideration by the Goverent. Despite this, it is uncertain when a vaccine will be in circulation or how successful it will be. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, warned it is unlikely a drug will be available until next spring. Speaking to the  Commons and Lords National Security Strategy Committee, he stated the virus will not be completely eradicated either. He said: It is unlikely we will end up with a truly sterilising vaccine.” Previously, officials had claimed the drug produced by AstraZeneca could be available by the turn of the year. Head of the UK's Vaccine Taskforce, Kate Bingham, claimed she was optimistic over the chances of a vaccine being developed by the UK's candidates. She said: I am optimistic that we will see something – four of our six vaccines are now in phase three studies, and in each of them we’ve seen very positive data in the phase one and two clinical studies, which shows that people who have received the vaccine do elicit a strong immune response, and that, and if you take the neutralising antibodies that are triggered those antibodies are able to kill live Covid virus. So that is very positive and it’s as good as it can be at the moment. And we now need to see whether or not those immune responses that we see translate into protection. This comes as 26,688 people tested positive for the virus in the UK across all settings - the total now stands at 789,229. There were also 191 deaths reported today. I have just been to Buckingham Palace, where Her Majesty The Queen has asked me to form a new government, and I accepted. In David Cameron, I follow in the footsteps of a great, modern Prime Minister. Under David’s leadership, the government stabilised the economy, reduced the budget deficit, and helped more people into work than ever before. But David’s true legacy is not about the economy but about social justice. From the introduction of same-sex marriage, to taking people on low wages out of income tax altogether; David Cameron has led a one-nation government, and it is in that spirit that I also plan to lead. Because not everybody knows this, but the full title of my party is the Conservative and Unionist Party, and that word ‘unionist’ is very important to me. It means we believe in the Union: the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But it means something else that is just as important; it means we believe in a union not just between the nations of the United Kingdom but between all of our citizens, every one of us, whoever we are and wherever we’re from. That means fighting against the burning injustice that, if you’re born poor, you will die on average 9 years earlier than others. If you’re black, you’re treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you’re white. If you’re a white, working-class boy, you’re less likely than anybody else in Britain to go to university. If you’re at a state school, you’re less likely to reach the top professions than if you’re educated privately. If you’re a woman, you will earn less than a man. If you suffer from mental health problems, there’s not enough help to hand. If you’re young, you’ll find it harder than ever before to own your own home. But the mission to make Britain a country that works for everyone means more than fighting these injustices. If you’re from an ordinary working class family, life is much harder than many people in Westminster realise. You have a job but you don’t always have job security. You have your own home, but you worry about paying a mortgage. You can just about manage but you worry about the cost of living and getting your kids into a good school. If you’re one of those families, if you’re just managing, I want to address you directly. I know you’re working around the clock, I know you’re doing your best, and I know that sometimes life can be a struggle. The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours. We will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives. When we take the big calls, we’ll think not of the powerful, but you. When we pass new laws, we’ll listen not to the mighty but to you. When it comes to taxes, we’ll prioritise not the wealthy, but you. When it comes to opportunity, we won’t entrench the advantages of the fortunate few. We will do everything we can to help anybody, whatever your background, to go as far as your talents will take you. We are living through an important moment in our country’s history. Following the referendum, we face a time of great national change. And I know because we’re Great Britain, that we will rise to the challenge. As we leave the European Union, we will forge a bold new positive role for ourselves in the world, and we will make Britain a country that works not for a privileged few, but for every one of us. That will be the mission of the government I lead, and together we will build a better Britain.",truth
7273a6ce,"Ives vs. Rauner: It's on. Letter to the Editor of The Washington Post by Mr. Dmitry Polyanskiy, First Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the UN, with regard to the article entitled “A dispatch from the fight against Russian disinformation – and a place where truth is winning” Dear Mr. Baron, I have to address you with regard to the article entitled “A dispatch from the fight against Russian disinformation – and a place where truth is winning” by Mr. Philip Bump, published in “The Washington Post” on 25 July 2018, which mentions me personally in the context of a very sensible topic for us – investigation of 2014 Malaysia Airlines MH17 crash in Ukraine. I would like to stress that I am writing this letter in my personal capacity and I am not directly involved in relevant investigative efforts on our side. But even the information that is available in open sources which could be traced by any researcher allows me to make the conclusions that I make. I would not conceal that I was very much disappointed by this publication which clearly does not meet the standards of an unbiased journalist report. Its main message is to illustrate alleged “Russian efforts to undercut findings” of “independent investigators” and “propaganda efforts of Russian government” in general. Needless to say that the article proceeds from the assumption that Russia was behind the downing of MH17 and all our efforts are aimed just at covering up the culprits. I completely disagree with such a narrative and want to clarify several key points in this regard. Since the very beginning Russia was and continues to be genuinely interested in discovering the truth about this tragic event. We supported all the efforts to conduct full and transparent investigation, we exercised our influence on Donbass rebels who, despite very difficult combat situation caused by the Ukrainian authorities’ obsession to punish their own citizens by military force for their desire to preserve their language and culture, provided unhindered and full access to the crash site. All those who wanted to visit it had the opportunity to do so. Every material evidence was also gathered and transported to the Netherlands for the needs of investigation. We from our side provided a lot of information and material to the investigation team, in particular primary radar data. Upon its request Russia disclosed classified information on Buk missiles 9M38 and 9M38M1. Our producer of this ammunition “Almaz-Antey” also modeled the incident and widely shared technical data and the conclusions of this simulation. The Dutch side is also aware of a lot of witness accounts of people living in this area. We expressed and continue to express our readiness to join the group of investigators. Nevertheless, the Dutch investigators since the very beginning showed particular distrust to our findings and contribution. Russian experts were excluded from their work. Much of the data that we provided was ignored and disregarded in the reports. The trend was very clear – to ignore everything that exposed Ukrainian responsibility for the downing of MH17 and to encourage every claim, be it undocumented or even absurd, that Russia or “Russian-backed rebels” were behind it. It is enough to indicate that the investigators do not press the US to provide satellite data from the day and the site of the crush Americans publicly confirmed that they possess such data, but it is “classified” and accept the refusal of Ukraine to provide primary radar data under laughable pretext. Refusal of Ukrainian authorities to close the airspace over the Eastern part of the country at the day of the crash despite ongoing military operation of Ukrainian forces there which is hard to explain by any logic is also disregarded. In the absence of any trustworthy proofs that “Russians did it” the Dutch investigators started to rely more and more on social media and on the findings of investigator groups like Bellingcat which is in the center of the article. To us the whole idea to use social media accounts as a proof in any investigation is extremely bizarre and doubtful. In our days it is not a problem any more to fake any video or photo with easily available software. We also have a lot of reasons not to trust particularly Bellingcat which was repeatedly caught red-handed by Internet users by voicing anti-Russian or anti-Syrian allegations based on fakes. And these fakes are largely exposed in the Web. Internet users have a lot of questions about Bellingcat financing, important American and Western funds that traditionally support anti-Russian campaigns are said to be the main sponsors of these “investigators”, which casts obvious doubt on their impartiality. Besides, there are a lot of other Internet social-media investigators on the Web who claim things opposite to the “findings” of Bellingcat that clearly indicate that Ukraine is behind the downing of MH17. Why are they ignored while Bellingcat accounts are praised and unquestioned? I personally tried to engage with Bellingcat through my Twitter account @dpol_un. But the moment I doubted their impartiality and illustrated upon their request that they produce fakes I faced a vicious verbal attack from them, including their founder Elliot Higgins who, as was claimed in the article “earned international attention for his exhaustive – and accurate – analysis...”. First of all, they said that I do not exist and called me “Kremlin bot” – a usual tactics for those who disrespect the opinion of the others on the Web. I have to say that this “journalist hero” of yours disappointed me most of all sending personal insults through Twitter. I enclose some of the snapshots for your reference. After the bellingcats, their trolls and bots continued to insult me, I had to blacklist some of them, including Higgins. Of course, no apologies followed up to today which is very illustrative of quality of their “work”. How can “responsible investigators” behave like this? There are hundreds of Internet users who already exposed their lies and all the bellingcats do is attack and bully these users. They just do not have other arguments besides insults and pathetic lies. I believe that the fact that you praise their efforts and close the eyes on all the numerous substantiated claims that they produce fakes is not becoming to the reputation of your distinguished paper. Nor it gives any credit to the Dutch investigators. But let’s put aside the bellingcats, let their conscience judge them, they obviously do not deserve so much attention. What worries me most of all is that after four years of the MH17 tragic accident we are still very far from establishing the truth. Unfortunately, the recent push of the Joint Investigation Team to hold Russia responsible on the basis of bellingcats’ findings, inconclusive and missing data from Ukraine and US and with total disregard of our data and documents is another step in this totally wrong direction. And the attempts to exploit the feelings of the relatives of the victims, mobilize them in support of these unsubstantiated claims are absolutely immoral. My country remains ready to join international investigative efforts to find the truth about MH17 crash. We are also consistently supporting the efforts to find those responsible of this crime and bring them to justice. Russia must be part of the investigation team and not its object – nobody has cancelled the presumption of innocence principle. What we do not accept are ultimatums and fakes. Given the fact that my name was quoted in the abovementioned article in a very dubious context I respectfully ask you to publish my letter in your newspaper. I will also make it open and publish it on the website of our Permanent Mission. Sincerely yours, Dmitry Polyanskiy First Deputy Permanent Representative",fake
8fba8857,"Christian Pastor In Vermont Sentenced To One Year In Prison After Refusing To Marry Gay Couple In a scenario straight out of “The Twilight Zone,” a group of NASA scientists working on an experiment in Antarctica have detected evidence of a parallel universe — where the rules of physics are the opposite of our own, according to a report. The concept of a parallel universe has been around since the early 1960s, mostly in the minds of fans of sci-fi TV shows and comics, but now a cosmic ray detection experiment has found particles that could be from a parallel realm that also was born in the Big Bang, the Daily Star reported. The experts used a giant balloon to carry NASA’s Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna, or ANITA, high above Antarctica, where the frigid, dry air provided the perfect environment with little to no radio noise to distort its findings. A constant “wind” of high-energy particles constantly arrives on Earth from outer space. Low-energy, subatomic neutrinos with a mass close to zero can pass completely through Earth, but higher-energy objects are stopped by the solid matter of our planet, according to the report. ANITA Antarctic Hang TestUniversity of Hawai'i at Manoa; That means the high-energy particles can only be detected coming “down” from space, but the team’s ANITA detected heavier particles, so-called tau neutrinos, which come “up” out of the Earth. The finding implies that these particles are actually traveling backward in time, suggesting evidence of a parallel universe, according to the Daily Star. Principal ANITA investigator Peter Gorham, an experimental particle physicist at the University of Hawaii, suggested that the only way the tau neutrino could behave that way is if it changed into a different type of particle before passing through the Earth and then back again. Gorham, lead author on a Cornell University paper describing the odd phenomenon, noted that he and his fellow researchers had seen several of these “impossible events,” which some were skeptical about. “Not everyone was comfortable with the hypothesis,” he told New Scientist. The simplest explanation for the phenomenon is that at the moment of the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, two universes were formed — ours and one that from our perspective is running in reverse with time going backward. Of course, if there are any inhabitants of a possible parallel universe, they’d consider us the backward ones. “We’re left with the most exciting or most boring possibilities,” said Ibrahim Safa, who also worked on the experiment.",fake

That view is at odds with the conclusions of the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt also told CNBC in March he does not believe global warming is primarily caused by CO2. Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC on Monday he does not believe carbon dioxide emissions from human activity are the main driver of climate change, joining the EPA administrator in casting doubt on the conclusion of some of the government’s WB_wombat_top scientists. Asked whether CO2 emissions are primarily responsible for climate change, Perry told CNBC’s “Squawk Box”: “No, most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.” “The fact is this shouldn’t be a debate about, ‘Is the climate changing, is man having an effect on it?’ Yeah, we are. The question should be just how much, and what are the policy changes that we need to make to effect that?” he said. In March, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt told “Squawk Box” he does not believe carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to global warming. Those statements contradict the public stance of the Environmental Protection Agency, at least until recently. Sec. Perry: Bringing back nuclear energy The EPA’s webpage on the causes of climate change used to state, “Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change.” The EPA recently took down the web page containing that statement. Perry and Pruitt’s views are also at odds with the conclusion of NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Despite those conclusions, Perry said, “This idea that science is just absolutely settled and if you don’t believe it’s settled then somehow you’re another neanderthal, that is so inappropriate from my perspective.” Being a skeptic about climate change issues is “quite all right,” he said, suggesting that skepticism is a sign of a “wise, intellectually engaged person.” President Donald Trump announced this month he would pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, an international effort to mitigate the effects of global warming. Since then, most of the president’s surrogates have declined to say whether he believes in climate change. The Trump administration has proposed slashing the Department of Energy’s funding. The Energy Department is shutting down the Office of International Climate and Technology, which works with other countries to develop clean energy technology, The New York Times reported last week. Under Trump, the United States has also backed away from a pledge to double research and development spending on energy technology to $6.4 billion by 2021.",fake

99fc8e17,"Sen. Doug Whitsett: Oregon gun bills wrap-up by Sen. Doug Whitsett More than a dozen bills relating to firearms were introduced during the recently concluded 77th Legislative Assembly. Most of those bills would have, in some way, impinged upon our second amendment right to own and bear firearms. A few of the more aggressive bills included: • House Bill 3200 that would have created the crime of unlawful possession or transfer of an assault weapon or large capacity magazine, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, or both. • House Bill 3413 that would have created the crime of endangering a minor, by allowing the minor access to a fire arm, punishable by up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $6,250, or both. • SB 347 that would have allowed each school district to establish their own rules regarding the right to carry a licensed concealed weapon on school property. Violation of the law would have constituted criminal trespass, resulting in penalties of up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $6,250, or both. This bill would also have preempted the current law that only allows the legislative body to create laws regulating firearms. • SB 699 that would have restricted the right to carry a concealed weapon in the capitol building by most licensed people without the written permission of the legislative administration. • SB 700 that would have required completion of a background check, before any firearm could be transferred between private parties. Failure to complete the background check could have resulted in penalties up to 5 years in prison, fines up to $125,000, or both. • SB 758 that would have required the owner of a firearm to carry specific liability insurance on each firearm in their possession. It also made it a crime to transfer a firearm to another person unless that individual carried liability insurance on the weapon. Failure to maintain liability insurance on each firearm would have resulted in fines of up to $10,000 per firearm. • SB 796 that would have required completion of a concealed handgun course, including a live fire test, before a concealed handgun license could be issued. It is unclear why our legislature should focus its attention on increasing the requirements to obtain a concealed carry permit. It seems that no one can remember the last time that an Oregon handgun licensee committed a crime with a firearm. Each of these bills, except HB 3413, had an emergency clause attached. The only reason for the emergency clause would have been to prevent the bill from being referred to the people to decide. None of these bills were enacted into Oregon law. The primary reason that the bills did not pass was because the Senate Leadership knew that the combined 15 no votes of 14 Senate Republicans, and of Senator Betsy Johnson, would have defeated each of the bills on the Senate floor. For that reason, they were never allowed to come to the Senate floor for a vote. From my perspective, that vote count is much too close for comfort. Your Legislative Assembly was within one vote of enacting each of those bills into Oregon law. It was within one vote of grossly impinging on our second amendment rights. Unfortunately, too many people are simply unaware of the facts regarding the possession of guns, and the commission of gun related crimes. In fact, most families have been convinced by media reports that gun related crimes are on the increase in America. That simply is not true! Over the past twenty years, the number of homicides committed with a firearm in the United States has decreased by nearly 40 percent. The number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has also plummeted, declining by nearly 70 percent. Unintended deaths by firearms have dropped by nearly 60 percent since 1993, and have decreased by more than 80 percent since 1929. This dramatic decline in the number of crimes committed with firearms has occurred during the same time period when our national population has increased from 250 million to 315 million people. During the same twenty years, more than 100 million guns have been sold to private citizens in the United States. Forty three percent of U.S homes now report that they possess one or more firearms. I would imagine that the gun owning percentage is actually much higher than reported, because many people who own firearms do not prefer to let anyone know that they have those weapons. All indicators point to the fact that our society becomes safer as more responsible families own guns. Nonetheless, gun violence is the third most often reported event by our news media. That rate of reporting is only surpassed by news reports on traffic and the weather. The media almost never reports the daily events where violence is prevented by an armed citizen. It is this constant media bias that is primarily responsible for people believing that gun violence is on the increase. In my opinion, our most important right, as citizens of the United States, is our constitutionally guaranteed Second Amendment right to own and bear firearms. Throughout recorded history, each and every would-be dictator and despot has first convinced the people to disarm, allegedly in order to make their society a safer and more peaceful place to live. Once they have given up their firearms they have been systematically stripped of all other human rights. We must not allow glib-speaking politicians, and a complicit news media, to convince us that we are safer without firearms. We are not safer. We are defenseless.

7d021245,"Clog the lines': Internet trolls deliberately disrupted the Iowa caucuses hotline for reporting results The phone number to report Iowa caucus results was posted on a fringe internet message board on Monday night along with encouragement to “clog the lines,” an indication that jammed phone lines that left some caucus managers on hold for hours may have in part been due to prank calls. An Iowa Democratic Party official said the influx of calls to the reporting hotline included “supporters of President Trump who called to express their displeasure with the Democratic Party.” The party official’s comments were first reported late Wednesday by Bloomberg News. Users on a politics-focused section of the fringe 4chan message board repeatedly posted the phone number for the Iowa Democratic Party, which was found by a simple Google search, both as screenshots and in plain text, alongside instructions. They have to call in the results now. Very long hold times being reported. Phone line being clogged, one user posted at about 11 p.m. ET on Monday, three hours after the caucuses began. Uh oh how unfortunate it would be for a bunch of mischief makers to start clogging the lines, responded another anonymous user, sarcastically. Some users chimed in, posting alleged wait times on hold, imploring others to “clog the lines [and] make the call lads.” Rob Sand, state auditor of Iowa, said he took results calls on Monday night as a volunteer and received an influx of calls that appeared to have been generated by a post on the internet. “A lot of calls came in at a certain point where it was clear somebody had published the hotline number somewhere,” Sand said. He cautioned that he could not speak for other people who were taking calls and said he did not get any calls that said they were from Trump supporters. He added that the system prevented people from reporting fake results. He also said he was able to identify fake calls quickly. “If I picked up the phone and it was clear after the first handful of words that someone was not calling to report the results, I just hung up,” Sand said. Mandy McClure, communications director for the Iowa Democratic Party, confirmed that the hotline received “an unusually high volume of inbound phone calls to its caucus hotline, including supporters of President Trump.” “The unexplained, and at times hostile, calls contributed to the delay in the Iowa Democratic Party’s collection of results, but in no way affected the integrity of information gathered or the accuracy of data sets reported,” McClure said in a statement. The telephone reporting problems added to other issues, notably a smartphone app that did not work for some people and that also had a coding problem that prevented results from being reported properly, pushing more caucus volunteers to the phone lines. Iowa Democratic Party officials said that party staff members and volunteers flagged and subsequently blocked repeat callers who appeared to be reaching out in an attempt to interfere with their reporting duties. These included callers who would hang up immediately after being connected and callers who expressed support for Trump and displeasure with the Democratic Party. It’s unclear how many prank calls the party received or how much they contributed to wait times. Some calls came from Iowans looking to confirm details of their evening’s caucus, party officials said. The party has not responded to requests for information on how many individuals were manning the phone lines on Monday night. The Trump campaign denied any affiliation with people clogging phone lines on Monday night. “We don’t know anything about this, but perhaps Democrats should consider using an app that works, communications director Tim Murtaugh said. It's laughable that they would try to blame Trump for their own incompetence. Several officials at caucuses attended by NBC News reporters struggled with lengthy hold times that made it impossible for them to report results. 4chan, which hosts an anonymous and often extremist politics board called /pol/ whose users have largely supported Trump since 2015, is known for extensive online political trolling and targeted harassment campaigns. On debate nights, 4chan users often direct one another to swarm and manipulate specific online polls on other websites with repeat votes, a practice known as “brigading” in online communities. The polls would then be used by politicians and partisan websites to claim shocking upsets. Users on 4chan are anonymous, and usernames are randomly generated with each new thread. Some users on 4chan pushed back against users claiming to spam phone lines on Monday night. One user said he didn’t want other trolls “making us the scapegoat for the DNC.” “I can’t wait for the news headlines saying nefarious trolls ruined the caucus,” another added. Two precinct chairs said they were unaware of any interference with the hotline and doubted it made much of an impact. “I wouldn’t blame the Republicans,” said Tom Courtney, co-chair of the Des Moines County Democratic Party and a precinct chair. “I’d love to blame the Republicans and the Trumpers, but I don’t know.” Mike Carberry, chair for a precinct in Iowa City, also said he doubted prank calls were the primary reason for long wait times. “I’m sure that they got some calls, but those could be sorted through relatively quickly,” he said. Another hotline staffer who asked to remain anonymous said they were aware of the prank calls but that they were not the main reason that results were delayed. “It was definitely a problem,” the staffer said. “But it was definitely not the reason that results were a mess.”",other
bf9f2cd6,"Broward County Sheriff Fired For Lying About Parkland Tony Abbott: Daring To Doubt 2017 Annual GWPF Lecture The Honourable Tony Abbott MP Former Prime Minister of Australia ‘Daring To Doubt’ London, 9 October 2017 Thank you for giving me the same platform that you’ve previously given to fellow Australians John Howard and George Pell. I will strive to be worthy of their example and their friendship; to offer a common sense way through the climate conflict; and, also, to place this particular issue in the broader struggle for practical wisdom now taking place across the Western world. It would be wrong to underestimate the strengths of the contemporary West. By objective standards, people have never had better lives. Yet our phenomenal wealth and our scientific and technological achievements rest on values and principles that have rarely been more widely challenged. To a greater or lesser extent, in most Western countries, we can’t keep our borders secure; we can’t keep our industries intact; and we can’t preserve a moral order once taken for granted. Eventually, something will crystalize out of this age of disruption but in the meantime we could be entering a period of national and even civilizational decline. In Australia, we’ve had ten years of disappointing government. It’s not just the churn of prime ministers that now rivals Italy’s, the internal divisions and the policy confusion that followed a quarter century of strong government under Bob Hawke and John Howard. It’s the institutional malaise. We have the world’s most powerful upper house: a Senate where good government can almost never secure a majority. Our businesses campaign for same sex marriage but not for economic reform. Our biggest company, BHP, the world’s premier miner, lives off the coal industry that it now wants to disown. And our oldest university, Sydney, now boasts that its mission is “unlearning”. Of course, to be an Australian is still to have won the lottery of life, and there’s yet no better place to live and work. But there’s a nagging sense that we’re letting ourselves down and failing to reach anything like our full potential. We are not alone in this. The Trump ascendancy, however it works out, was a popular revolt against politics-as-usual. Brexit was a rejection of the British as well as of the European establishments. Yes, the centrist, Macron, won in France but only by sidelining the parties that had ruled from the start of the Fifth Republic. And while the German chancellor was re-elected, seemingly it’s at the head of an unstable coalition after losing a quarter of her vote. Everywhere, there’s a breakdown of public trust between voters and their leaders for misdiagnosing problems, for making excuses about who’s to blame, and for denying the damage that’s been done. Since the Global Financial Crisis, at least in the West, growth has been slow, wages stagnant, opportunities limited, and economic and cultural disruption unprecedented. Within countries and between them, old pecking orders are changing. Civilizational self-doubt is everywhere; we believe in everyone but ourselves; and everything is taken seriously except that which used to be. Just a few years ago, history was supposed to have ended in the triumph of the Western liberal order. Yet far from becoming universal, Western values are less and less accepted even in the West itself. We still more or less accept that every human being is born with innate dignity; with rights, certainly, but we’re less sure about the corresponding duties. We still accept the golden rule of human conduct: to treat others as we would have them treat us – or to use the Gospel formula to “love your neighbour as you love yourself” – but we’re running on empty. In Britain and Australia, scarcely 50 per cent describe themselves as Christian, down from 90 per cent a generation back. For decades, we’ve been losing our religious faith but we’re fast losing our religious knowledge too. We’re less a post-Christian society than a non-Christian, or even an anti-Christian one. It hasn’t left us less susceptible to dogma, though, because we still need things to believe in and causes to fight for; it’s just that believers can now be found for almost anything and everything. Climate change is by no means the sole or even the most significant symptom of the changing interests and values of the West. Still, only societies with high levels of cultural amnesia – that have forgotten the scriptures about man created “in the image and likeness of God” and charged with “subduing the earth and all its creatures” – could have made such a religion out of it. There’s no certain way to regain cultural self-confidence. The heart of any recovery, though, has to be an honest facing of facts and an insistence upon intellectual rigour. More than ever, the challenge of leadership is to say what you mean and do what you say. The lesson I’ve taken from being in government, and then out of it, is simply to speak my mind. The risk, when people know where you stand, is losing their support. The certainty, when people don’t know where you stand, is losing their respect. Of course, we’re all nostalgic for the days when governments and oppositions could agree on the big issues; but pleading for bi-partisanship won’t create it. As my government showed on border protection policy, the only way to create a new consensus is to argue the case, to make a decision, and then to let the subsequent facts speak for themselves. The modern world, after all, is not the product of a successful search for consensus. It’s what’s emerged from centuries of critical enquiry and hard clash. Without the constant curiosity and endless questioning that has driven our scientists and engineers, and the constant striving for improvement that’s long guided our planners and policy makers, there’d be no cures for disease, no labour-saving appliances, no sanitation, no urban improvement, no votes for women, no respect for minorities; in other words, no modern world. That may not actually bother some green activists whose ideal is an Amish existence, only without reference to God. But it should bother anyone and everyone who wants longer, safer, more comfortable and more prosperous lives. Beware the pronouncement, “the science is settled”. It’s the spirit of the Inquisition, the thought-police down the ages. Almost as bad is the claim that “99 per cent of scientists believe” as if scientific truth is determined by votes rather than facts. There are laws of physics; there are objective facts; there are moral and ethical truths. But there is almost nothing important where no further enquiry is needed. What the “science is settled” brigade want is to close down investigation by equating questioning with superstition. It’s an aspect of the wider weakening of the Western mind which poses such dangers to the world’s future. Physics suggests, all other things being equal, that an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide would indeed warm the planet. Even so, the atmosphere is an almost infinitely complex mechanism that’s far from fully understood. Palaeontology indicates that over millions of years there have been warmer periods and cooler periods that don’t correlate with carbon dioxide concentrations. The Jurassic warm period and the ice ages occurred without any human contribution at all. The medieval warm period when crops were grown in Greenland and the mini-ice age when the Thames froze over occurred well before industrial activities added to atmospheric carbon dioxide. Prudence and respect for the planet would suggest taking care not lightly to increase carbon dioxide emissions; but the evidence suggests that other factors such as sun spot cycles and oscillations in the Earth’s orbit are at least as important for climate change as this trace gas – which, far from being pollution, is actually essential for life to exist. Certainly, no big change has accompanied the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration over the past century from roughly 300 to roughly 400 parts per million or from 0.03 to 0.04 per cent. Contrary to the breathless assertions that climate change is behind every weather event, in Australia, the floods are not bigger, the bushfires are not worse, the droughts are not deeper or longer, and the cyclones are not more severe than they were in the 1800s. Sometimes, they do more damage but that’s because there’s more to destroy, not because their intensity has increased. More than 100 years of photography at Manly Beach in my electorate does not suggest that sea levels have risen despite frequent reports from climate alarmists that this is imminent. It may be that a tipping point will be reached soon and that the world might start to warm rapidly but so far reality has stubbornly refused to conform to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s computer modelling. Even the high-priests of climate change now seem to concede that there was a pause in warming between the 1990s and 2014. So far, though, there’s no concession that their models might require revision even though unadjusted data suggests that the 1930s were actually the warmest decade in the United States and that temperatures in Australia have only increased by 0.3 degrees over the past century, not the 1 degree usually claimed. The growing evidence that records have been adjusted, that the impact of urban heat islands has been downplayed, and that data sets have been slanted in order to fit the theory of dangerous anthropogenic global warming does not make it false; but it should produce much caution about basing drastic action upon it. Then there’s the evidence that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide (which is a plant food after all) are actually greening the planet and helping to lift agricultural yields. In most countries, far more people die in cold snaps than in heat waves, so a gradual lift in global temperatures, especially if it’s accompanied by more prosperity and more capacity to adapt to change, might even be beneficial. In what might be described as Ridley’s paradox, after the distinguished British commentator: at least so far, it’s climate change policy that’s doing harm; climate change itself is probably doing good; or at least, more good than harm. Australia, for instance, has the world’s largest readily available supplies of coal, gas and uranium, yet thanks to a decade of policy based more on green ideology than common sense, we can’t be sure of keeping the lights on this summer; and, in the policy-induced shift from having the world’s lowest power prices to amongst the highest, our manufacturing industry has lost its one, big comparative economic advantage. About 20 years ago, in Australia, limiting carbon dioxide emissions first became a goal of public policy. It was the Howard government, back in 1997, that originally introduced the Renewable Energy Target, a stealth carbon tax, requiring energy suppliers to source a percentage of their power from new renewable generation. But in those far off days, it was just 2 per cent. During the energy discussions around the Howard cabinet table, I recall thinking “why not encourage more solar hot water systems to reduce power use” and “why not incentivise the installation of solar panels to help power people’s homes”? Way back in the 1980s, in my final provost’s collection at The Queen’s College, Lord Blake had observed: “Mr Abbott needs to temper his robust common sense with a certain philosophic doubt”. If only more of us had realised sooner how easy it was with renewable power to have too much of a good thing! Unsurprisingly, a conservative cabinet did indeed respond to farmers’ worries about the drought then gripping eastern Australia; and the public’s then eagerness to support environmental gestures with other people’s money. We thought we could reduce emissions, or at least limit their increase, without much disruption to everyday life, hence these gestures to the zeitgeist. Where the subsidy was modest and the impact on the power system minimal, our thinking ran, why not accommodate the feel-good urge to be “responsible global citizens”? In its last few months, the Howard government even agreed in-principle to support an emissions trading scheme. But Howard was shrewd enough to know how the most important consequences of any policy were often the unintended ones. His government’s refusal to ratify the Kyoto climate change treaty, even though we’d secured a good deal for Australia, showed his caution about the impact of emissions reduction on power prices and the wider economy. For the incoming Labor Prime Minister after 2007, though, climate change was nothing less than the “greatest moral challenge of our time”. The Rudd-Gillard government believed in an emissions trading scheme, no ifs, no buts, and in a ten-fold increase in the mandatory use of renewables. For a while, the Liberal-National opposition was inclined to go along with it. My own leaning for the first year or so was not to oppose it; but my doubts about the theory of climate change were growing and my sense that an ETS would turn out to be a “great big new tax on everything” was hardening. To a party audience in country Victoria in October 2009, I observed that the so-called settled science of climate change was “absolute crap”; and after winning the opposition leadership had a secret party room ballot to oppose an ETS because it was not our job to enter into weak compromises with a bad government. As it happened, the 2010 election was more about power prices than about saving the planet. Under great political pressure, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard, declared “there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead”. But early in 2011, as part of her minority government’s deal with the Greens, she committed to a carbon tax that would put wholesale power prices up by 40 per cent. The 2013 election was a referendum on Labor’s carbon tax – as well as Labor’s complete loss of control over our maritime borders – with a thumping win to the Liberal-National Coalition. In July 2014, the Abbott government abolished the carbon tax, saving the average household about $500 a year. In early 2015, we reduced the Renewable Energy Target from 28 to 23 per cent. It wasn’t enough, but it was the best that we could get through the Senate. My cabinet always had some ministers focussed on jobs and cost of living; and others more concerned with emissions reduction, even though our contribution to global emissions was barely one per cent. Inevitably, our Paris agreement to a 26 to 28 per cent emissions reduction was a compromise based on the advice that we could achieve it largely through efficiencies, without additional environmental imposts, using the highly successful emissions reduction fund; because, as I said at the time, “the last thing we want to do is strengthen the environment (but) damage our economy”. At last year’s election, the government chose not to campaign on power prices even though Labor was promising a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target (requiring a $50 billion over-build of wind farms) and a 45 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 (requiring a new carbon tax). After a net gain of 25 seats at the previous two elections, when we had campaigned on power prices, we had a net loss of 14 when we didn’t. And subsequent events have made the politics of power once more the central battleground between and within the two main parties. Although manufacturing, agriculture and transport are also large carbon dioxide emitters, the politics of emissions reduction has always focussed on power generation because shifting to renewables has always been more saleable to voters than closing down industry, giving up cars and not eating beef. As a badge of environmental virtue, the South Australian state Labor government had been boasting that, on average, almost 50 per cent of its power was wind-generated – although at any moment it could vary from almost zero to almost 100 per cent. It had even ostentatiously blown up its one coal-fired power station. In September last year, though, the wind blew so hard that the turbines had to shut down – and the inter-connector with Victoria and its reliable coal-fired power failed too. For 24 hours, there was a state wide blackout. For nearly two million people, the lights were off, cash registers didn’t work, traffic lights went down, lifts stopped, and patients were sent home from hospitals. Throughout last summer, there were further blackouts and brownouts across eastern Australia requiring hundreds of millions in repairs to the plant of energy-intensive industries. Despite this, in a display of virtue signalling, to flaunt its environmental credentials (and to boost prices for its other coal-fired plants), last March the French-government part-owned multinational, Engie, closed down the giant Hazelwood coal-fired station that had supplied a quarter of Victoria’s power. The Australian Energy Market Operator is now sufficiently alarmed to have just issued an official warning of further blackouts this summer in Victoria and South Australia and severe medium term power shortfalls. But in yet more virtue-signalling, energy giant AGL is still threatening to close the massive Liddell coal-fired power station in NSW and replace it with a subsidised solar farm and a much smaller gas-fired power station relying on gas supplies that don’t currently exist. Were it not rational behaviour based on irrational government policy, this deliberate elimination of an essential service could only be described as a form of economic self-harm. Hydro aside, renewable energy should properly be referred to as intermittent and unreliable power. When the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine, the power doesn’t flow. Wind and solar power are like sailing ships; cheaper than powered boats, to be sure, but we’ve stopped using sail for transport because it couldn’t be trusted to turn up on time. Because the weather is unpredictable, you never really know when renewable power is going to work. Its marginal cost is low but so is its reliability, so in the absence of industrial scale batteries, it always needs matching capacity from dependable coal, gas, hydro, or nuclear energy. This should always have been obvious. Also now apparent is the system instability and the perverse economics that subsidised renewables on a large scale have injected into our power supply. Not only is demand variable but there’s a vast and unpredictable difference between potential and dispatch-able capacity at any one time. Having to turn coal fired power stations up or down as the wind changes makes them much less profitable even though coal remains by far the cheapest source of reliable power. A market that’s driven by subsidies rather than by economics always fails. Subsidy begets subsidy until the system collapses into absurdity. In Australia’s case, having subsidised renewables, allegedly to save the planet; we’re now faced with subsidising coal, just to keep the lights on. We have got ourselves into this mess because successive federal governments have tried to reduce emissions rather than to ensure reliable and affordable power; because, rather than give farmers a fairer return, state governments have given in to green lobbyists and banned or heavily restricted gas exploration and extraction; and because shareholder activists have scared power companies out of new investment in fossil fuel power generation, even though you can’t run a modern economy without it. In the short term, to avoid blackouts, we have to get mothballed or under-utilised gas back into the system. In the medium term, there must be – first – no subsidies, none, for new intermittent power (and a freeze on the RET should be no problem if renewables are as economic as the boosters claim); second, given the nervousness of private investors, there must be a government-built coal-fired power station to overcome political risk; third, the gas bans must go; and fourth, the ban on nuclear power must go too in case a dry country ever needs base load power with zero emissions. The government is now suggesting that there might not be a new Clean Energy Target after all. There must not be – and we still need to deal with what’s yet to come under the existing target. In the longer term, we need less theology and more common sense about emissions reduction. It matters but not more than everything else. As Clive James has suggested in a celebrated recent essay, we need to get back to evidence based policy rather than “policy based evidence”. Even if reducing emissions really is necessary to save the planet, our effort, however Herculean, is barely-better-than-futile; because Australia’s total annual emissions are exceeded by just the annual increase in China’s. There’s a veneer of rational calculation to emissions reduction but underneath it’s about “doing the right thing”. Environmentalism has managed to combine a post-socialist instinct for big government with a post-Christian nostalgia for making sacrifices in a good cause. Primitive people once killed goats to appease the volcano gods. We’re more sophisticated now but are still sacrificing our industries and our living standards to the climate gods to little more effect. So far, climate change policy has generated new taxes, new subsidies and new restrictions in rich countries; and new demands for more aid from poor countries. But for the really big emitters, China and India, it’s a first world problem. Between them, they’re building or planning more than 800 new coal-fired power stations – often using Australian coal – with emissions, on average, 30 per cent lower than from our own ageing generators. Unsurprisingly, the recipients of climate change subsidies and climate change research grants think action is very urgent indeed. As for the general public, of course saving the planet counts – until the bills come in and then the humbug detector is switched on. Should Australia close down its steel industry; watch passively while its aluminium industry moves offshore to places less concerned about emissions; export coal, but not use it ourselves; and deliberately increase power prices for people who can’t install their own solar panels and batteries? Of course not, but these are the inevitable consequences of continuing current policies. That’s the reality no one has wanted to face for a long time: that we couldn’t reduce emissions without also hurting the economy; that’s the inconvenient truth that can now no longer be avoided. The only rational choice is to put Australian jobs and Australia’s standard of living first; to get emissions down but only as far as we can without putting prices up. After two decades’ experience of the very modest reality of climate change but the increasingly dire consequences of the policy to deal with it, anything else would be a dereliction of duty as well as a political death wish. I congratulate the Global Warming Policy Foundation for your commitment to rational inquiry; your insistence that the theory must be made to fit the facts, rather than the other way round; your concern to do good, rather than just to seem good; and for the hope I share with you: that, in the end, the best policy will turn out to be the best politics. I’m reminded of the story of a man randomly throwing pieces of paper from the window of a train. Eventually his companion asked him why he did it. It keeps the elephants down, he said. “But there are no elephants here”, his companion replied. “Precisely; it’s a very successful method”. A tendency to fear catastrophe is ingrained in the human psyche. Looking at the climate record over millions of years, one day it will probably come; whatever we do today won’t stop it, and when it comes, it will have little to do with the carbon dioxide emissions of mankind.",fake

9f10a8a9,"A 62% Top Tax Rate? It was an accurate and judicious answer, so naturally it sent climate alarmists into paroxysms of condemnation. The Washington Post slammed Pruitt as a “denier” driven by “unreason.” Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii called Pruitt’s views “extreme” and “irresponsible” — proof of his unfitness to head the EPA. Gina McCarthy, who ran the agency under President Obama, bewailed the danger global warming poses “to all of us who call Earth home,” and said she couldn’t “imagine what additional information [Pruitt] might want from scientists” in order to understand that. Replied Pruitt: “No. I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no — I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. But we don’t know that yet. We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.” ‘Do you believe,” CNBC’s Joe Kernen asked Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency’s new director, in an interview last Thursday, “that it’s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob for climate?” Yet for all the hyperventilating, Pruitt’s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate’s “primary control knob” — was entirely sound. “We don’t know that yet,” he said. We don’t. CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent. Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all. Advertisement There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor, thereby increasing warming through a “positive feedback loop.” But that theory so far is mostly speculative; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed, nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred. It should go without saying that if scientists cannot yet make accurate predictions about future climate change, then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete. Advertisement Earth’s climate system is unfathomably complex. It is affected by innumerable interacting variables, atmospheric CO2 levels being just one. The more variables there are in any system or train of events, the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass. Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e., ½ x ½ Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable: just 1 in 8. Apply that approach to climate change, and it becomes clear why the best response to the alarmists’ frantic predictions is a healthy skepticism. The list of variables that shape climate includes cloud formation, topography, altitude, proximity to the equator, plate tectonics, sunspot cycles, volcanic activity, expansion or contraction of sea ice, conversion of land to agriculture, deforestation, reforestation, direction of winds, soil quality, El Niño and La Niña ocean cycles, prevalence of aerosols (airborne soot, dust, and salt) — and, of course, atmospheric greenhouse gases, both natural and manmade. A comprehensive list would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision. Advertisement But for the sake of argument, say there are merely 15 variables involved in predicting global climate change, and assume that climatologists have mastered each one to a near-perfect accuracy of 95 percent. What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable? Less than 50/50. (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.) Is it any surprise that climate-change predictions in the real world — where the complexities are exponentially greater and the exactitude of knowledge much less — have such a poor track record? Pruitt got it right: Measuring human impacts on climate is indeed “very challenging.” The science is far from settled. That is why calls to radically reduce carbon emissions are so irresponsible — and why dire warnings of what will happen if we don’t are little better than reckless fearmongering.",other

The idea for a British sign language alternative for clapping involving the waving of hands was put forward at the student union's first meeting of the year on Tuesday. Sabbatical Officers Roisin McCallion, Vice President for Welfare and Equal Opportunity and Ebie Edwards Cole, Chair for Oxford SU Disabilities Campaign, successfully passed the motion to mandate the encouragement of silent clapping. Sabbatical Officers Roisin McCallion (left), Vice President for Welfare and Equal Opportunity and Ebie Edwards Cole (right), Chair for Oxford SU Disabilities Campaign, successfully passed the motion to mandate the encouragement of silent clapping They argued that alternatives to traditional clapping have been in place to aid accessibility in some organisations since 2015. The ban on clapping would be at student union meetings and events where traditional clapping and cheering 'presents an access issue' to those with anxiety disorders. One former student, said: 'Oxford University Student Union is always seeking to be more accommodating for students. Especially for those with accessibility issues. 'But this idea will not work and is completely ludicrous.' The use of jazz hands - where students wave their hands in the air - is the British Sign Language expression for applause and is deemed a more inclusive gesture. The motion, which carried, mandates the encouragement of sign language clapping by Sabbatical Officers at union meetings and events (file photo of students at the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford) It comes after the University of Manchester Students Union passed a motion to do the same thing in September last year. Ms McCallion said: 'The policy was proposed in order to encourage the use of British Sign Language clapping during our democratic events to make those events more accessible and inclusive for all, including people who suffer from anxiety.

Celia Israel Disappointed in Court Ruling Finding School Finance System Unconstitutional, Calls for Immediate Special Session Austin - Rep. Celia Israel (D-Travis County) is asking Gov. Abbott to call a special session to fully fund public education in light of today's Texas Supreme Court decision upholding the current woefully inadequate school finance system. I am extremely disappointed in the ruling today from the Texas Supreme Court. It was especially surprising to see the court label our system 'Byzantine' and 'meeting minimal standards' at the same time. Israel said. Texas deserves better. We cannot continue to crow about our economic growth and continue to act as if a 'Byzantine' system serves our children and our future well. I call upon Governor Abbott to immediately call a Special Session so Texas can fully invest in its education system. Israel expressed disappointment in the Court's ruling striking down Judge John Dietz's finding lawmakers ignored the real costs of education and the impact of the significant cuts made during the 2011 Session, all the while raising standards for Texas students and requiring schools to provide more elaborate programs. The Court's ruling appears to leave the Legislature as the last word as to whether Texas is fulfilling its constitutional mandate to make suitable provision for the support and maintenance of an efficient system of public schools. When adjusted for inflation, per student spending has remained relatively flat over the past 16 years. Despite that trend, Texas schools in 2017 will receive $381 less per student than they did in 2003. It would take an additional $3.5 billion next biennium just to get our schools where they were 14 years ago. At the same time, state support for public schools continues to fall behind the cost of inflation, does not account for changes in student needs or academic standards, and fails to fund equitably between districts. It's time for big ideas and Texas-sized leadership, Israel said, noting her constituents will no longer accept the business as usual approach to education funding, even with the Court's ruling. I am confident that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will work together to make a public school system that provides the resources needed for all students to be successful, no matter where they live or what their background. I am ready to get to work. -30-",partial

Carswell responded: “That’s why we make the big bucks.” Set up under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the DOJ’s CRS, the employees of which are required by law to “conduct their activities in confidence,” reportedly has greatly expanded its role under President Barack Obama. Though the agency claims to use “impartial mediation practices and conflict resolution procedures,” press reports along with the documents obtained by Judicial Watch suggest that the unit deployed to Sanford, FL, took an active role in working with those demanding the prosecution of Zimmerman. On April 15, 2012, during the height of the protests, the Orlando Sentinel reported, “They [the CRS] helped set up a meeting between the local NAACP and elected officials that led to the temporary resignation of police Chief Bill Lee according to Turner Clayton, Seminole County chapter president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.” The paper quoted the Rev. Valarie Houston, pastor of Allen Chapel AME Church, a focal point for protestors, as saying “They were there for us,” after a March 20 meeting with CRS agents. Separately, in response to a Florida Sunshine Law request to the City of Sanford, Judicial Watch also obtained an audio recording of a “community meeting” held at Second Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Sanford on April 19, 2012. The meeting, which led to the ouster of Sanford’s Police Chief Bill Lee, was scheduled after a group of college students calling themselves the “Dream Defenders” barricaded the entrance to the police department demanding Lee be fired. According to the Orlando Sentinel, DOJ employees with the CRS had arranged a 40-mile police escort for the students from Daytona Beach to Sanford. “These documents detail the extraordinary intervention by the Justice Department in the pressure campaign leading to the prosecution of George Zimmerman,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “My guess is that most Americans would rightly object to taxpayers paying government employees to help organize racially-charged demonstrations.”",partial

92e17268,"THIS IS AMAZING: In 1984, the New York Times said Trump would be our BEST president…They forgot….. Western media recently launched a new round of attacks on China's religious freedom. The country's major religious associations on Tuesday proposed an initiative demanding that all religious venues raise China's national flag to strengthen awareness of respect for the flag and preserve the flag's dignity. This move, however, was interpreted by some Western media outlets as an attempt to expand the country's ideological control over religious life. Over two months ago when the China Islamic Association urged mosques in China to fly national flags to promote patriotism among Muslims, the West also accused China of tightening its grip on religion and intervening in religious freedom. A national flag is a symbol of the country that should be respected by all citizens. The display of national flags is not only recognition of national sovereignty, but also a manifestation of love for the country. Hanging a flag at religious sites is meant to enhance the concept of nation and civic consciousness among religious people. Promoting patriotism isn't at odds with protecting freedom of religion, Islam, for instance, emphasizes patriotism as a part of faith. For multi-ethnic and multi-religious countries like China, strengthening people's national and civic consciousness is of particular importance. Colonialists divided national borders according to nationality and religion, which led to serious conflicts to Asian countries, as is the case with India and Pakistan. China must draw lessons from this and ratchet up efforts to build religious people's national and civic consciousness. Religions are exclusive. The key to make them live in harmony is to sustain their national identity. If the shared sense of national identity collapsed, the country would be divided or even lurch toward war. Thanks to China's effective religious governance, religions have developed rapidly in China over the years. The Chinese government adopts the principle of separating religion from politics and respects freedom of religion. Legal religious activities are not only allowed in any region of China, but also well protected. However in an attempt to divide China's national unity, many Western forces have repeatedly made an issue of the country's religious freedom, making groundless claims that religious groups are suppressed in China. When the American flag is raised, all Americans, regardless of race or religion, stand up to show their respect. China has every reason to strengthen national identity and civic consciousness among religious people. Flying the national flag at religious sites is a good way to do so. Without a stable country as the foundation of religious belief, religion will only cause division.",fake

86955ba5,"Lawyers raked in £32.2bn in just ONE year: Figure goes up by a quarter in just five years In my experience, good public policy is best shaped by the dispassionate analysis of what in practice has worked, or not. Policy based on common assumptions and popular sentiments can become a recipe for mistaken prescriptions and misguided interventions. Nowhere is this divorce between rhetoric and reality more evident than in the formulation of global drug policies, where too often emotions and ideology rather than evidence have prevailed. Take the case of the medical use of cannabis. By looking carefully at the evidence from the United States, we now know that legalizing the use of cannabis for medical purposes has not, as opponents argued, led to an increase in its use by teenagers. By contrast, there has been a near tripling of American deaths from heroin overdoses between 2010 and 2013, even though the law and its severe punishments remain unchanged. This year, between April 19 and 21, the United Nations General Assembly will hold a special session on drugs and the world will have a chance to change course. As we approach that event, we need to ask ourselves if we are on the right policy path. More specifically, how do we deal with what the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has called the unintended consequences of the policies of the last 50 years, which have helped, among other things, to create a vast, international criminal market in drugs that fuels violence, corruption and instability? Just think of the 16,000 murders in Mexico in 2013, many of which are directly linked to drug trafficking. A War on the People Globally, the war on drugs has not succeeded. Some estimate that enforcing global prohibition costs at least $100 billion (€90.7 billion) a year, but as many as 300 million people now use drugs worldwide, contributing to a global illicit market with a turnover of $330 billion a year, one of the largest commodity markets in the world. Prohibition has had little impact on the supply of or demand for drugs. When law enforcement succeeds in one area, drug production simply moves to another region or country, drug trafficking moves to another route and drug users switch to a different drug. Nor has prohibition significantly reduced use. Studies have consistently failed to establish the existence of a link between the harshness of a country's drug laws and its levels of drug use. The widespread criminalization and punishment of people who use drugs, the over­crowded prisons, mean that the war on drugs is, to a significant degree, a war on drug users ­­ a war on people. Africa is sadly an example of these problems. The West Africa Commission on Drugs, which my foundation convened, reported last year that the region has now become not only a major transit point between producers in Latin America and consumers in Europe, but an area where consumption is increasing. Drug money, and the criminality associated with it, is fostering corruption and violence. The stability of countries and the region as a whole is under threat. I believe that drugs have destroyed many lives, but wrong government policies have destroyed many more. We all want to protect our families from the potential harm of drugs. But if our children do develop a drug problem, surely we will want them cared for as patients in need of treatment and not branded as criminals. Stop Stigmatizing and Start Helping The tendency in many parts of the world to stigmatize and incarcerate drug users has prevented many from seeking medical treatment. In what other areas of public health do we criminalize patients in need of help? Punitive measures have sent many people to prison, where their drug use has worsened. A criminal record for a young person for a minor drug offense can be a far greater threat to their wellbeing than occasional drug use. The original intent of drug policy, according to the UN Convention on Narcotic Drugs, was to protect the health and welfare of mankind. We need to refocus international and national policy on this key objective. This requires us to take four critical steps. First, we must decriminalize personal drug use. The use of drugs is harmful and reducing those harms is a task for the public health system, not the courts. This must be coupled with the strengthening of treatment services, especially in middle and low­ income countries. Second, we need to accept that a drug­-free world is an illusion. We must focus instead on ensuring that drugs cause the least possible harm. Harm reduction measures, such as needle exchange programs, can make a real difference. Germany adopted such measures early on and the level of HIV infections among injecting drug users is close to 5 percent, compared to over 40 percent in some countries which resist this pragmatic approach. Third, we have to look at regulation and public education rather than the total suppression of drugs, which we know will not work. The steps taken successfully to reduce tobacco consumption (a very powerful and damaging addiction) show what can be achieved. It is regulation and education, not the threat of prison, which has cut the number of smokers in many countries. Higher taxes, restrictions on sale and effective anti­-smoking campaigns have delivered the right results. The legal sale of cannabis is a reality that started with California legalizing the sale of cannabis for medical use in 1996. Since then, 22 U.S. states and some European countries have followed suit. Others have gone further still. A voter initiative which gained a majority at the ballot box has caused Colorado to legalize the sale of cannabis for recreational use. Last year, Colorado collected around $135 million in taxes and license fees related to legal cannabis sales. Others have taken less commercial routes. Users of Spain's cannabis social clubs can grow and buy cannabis through small noncommercial organizations. And Canada looks likely to become the first G7 country to regulate the sale of cannabis next year. Legal Regulation Protects Health Initial trends show us that where cannabis has been legalized, there has been no explosion in drug use or drug­ related crime. The size of the black market has been reduced and thousands of young people have been spared criminal records. But a regulated market is not a free market. We need to carefully think through what needs regulating, and what does not. While most cannabis use is occasional, moderate and not associated with significant problems, it is nonetheless precisely because of its potential risks that it needs to be regulated. And therefore, the fourth and final step is to recognize that drugs must be regulated precisely because they are risky. It is time to acknowledge that drugs are infinitely more dangerous if they are left solely in the hands of criminals who have no concerns about health and safety. Legal regulation protects health. Consumers need to be aware of what they are taking and have clear information on health risks and how to minimize them. Governments need to be able to regulate vendors and outlets according to how much harm a drug can cause. The most risky drugs should never be available over the counter but only via medical prescription for people registered as dependent users, as is already happening in Switzerland. Scientific evidence and our concern for health and human rights must shape drug policy. This means making sure that fewer people die from drug overdoses and that small-­time offenders do not end up in jail where their drug problems get worse. It is time for a smarter, health­-based approach to drug policy. It is time for countries, such as Germany, which have adopted better policies at home, to strongly advocate for policy change abroad. The United Nations General Assembly special session on the world drug problem would be a good place to start.",partial

Today is the first anniversary of the greatest single assault on our freedom in my lifetime: the signing of ObamaCare. As we consider what this law may do to our country, I can't help but reflect on a medical miracle made possible by the American health-care system. It's one that holds special meaning for me. Some years ago, a little girl was born with a serious heart defect: Her aorta and pulmonary artery were reversed. Without immediate intervention, she would not have survived. The infant was rushed to another hospital where a surgeon performed a procedure at 1 a.m. that saved her life. Eight months later, when her heart was the size of a small plum, an incredibly dedicated and skilled team of medical professionals surgically reconstructed it. Twenty-seven years later, the young woman is now a nurse in a neonatal intensive care unit where she is studying to become a nurse practitioner. She wasn't saved by a bureaucrat, and no government mandate forced her parents to purchase the coverage that saved her. Instead, her care was provided under a run-of-the-mill plan available to every employee of an Oshkosh, Wis., plastics plant. If you haven't guessed, this story touches my heart because the girl is my daughter, Carey. And my wife and I are incredibly thankful that we had the freedom to seek out the most advanced surgical technique. The procedure that saved her, and has given her a chance at a full life, was available because America has a free-market system that has advanced medicine at a phenomenal pace.",fake
85100e77,"Prime Minister orders urgent action to improve vaccination uptake For years, the mainstream media has ignored the problem of voter fraud and belittled those of us who are trying to do something about it. And when secretaries of state like me identify cases of fraud, we are told that the number of incidents of voter fraud is too insignificant to matter. Now, however, facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on November 8, 2016: New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshire’s four electoral college votes in the presidential election. New Hampshire is one of fifteen states that allow same-day voter registration. The benefit of same-day registration is that it allows a person who has procrastinated or has forgotten to register to nonetheless cast a ballot on election day. The downside of same-day registration is that it does not allow the state time to assess the eligibility of the voter. A volunteer poll worker simply accepts a modicum of identification and takes the voter at his word that he’s a U.S. citizen resident of the state who is eligible to vote. New Hampshire is also a battleground state. Unlike neighboring Massachusetts and Vermont, which reliably vote for the Democrat in presidential elections, New Hampshire can swing either way. It has long been reported, anecdotally, that out-of-staters take advantage of New Hampshire’s same-day registration and head to the Granite State to cast fraudulent votes. Now there’s proof. According to statistics released by the Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, on the date of the general election in November 2016, there were 6,540 same-day registrants who registered to vote in New Hampshire using an out-of-state driver’s license to prove their identity. In and of itself, that doesn’t prove that any fraud occurred – theoretically, each of those individuals could have been someone who recently moved to the State and had not yet had time to get a New Hampshire driver’s license. According to New Hampshire law, a new resident has 60 days to obtain a New Hampshire driver’s license. So if those 6,540 voters were bona fide New Hampshire residents, they would get their driver’s license no later than January 7, 2017. However, the numbers tell a very different story. It turns out that, as of August 30, 2017 – nearly ten months after the election – only 1,014 of the 6,540 same-day registrants who registered with an out-of-state license had obtained a New Hampshire driver’s license. The other 5,526 individuals never obtained a New Hampshire driver’s license. And, of those 5,526, only 213 registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. So 5,313 of those voters neither obtained a New Hampshire driver’s license nor registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. They have not followed the legal requirements for residents regarding driver’s licenses, and it appears that they are not actually residing in New Hampshire. It seems that they never were bona fide residents of the State. 5,513 is a big number – more than enough to swing two very important elections. The closest major election was the contest between incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte and challenger Maggie Hassan (D). Hassan won the election by a razor-thin margin of 1,017 votes. Those 5,313 fraudulent votes were more than enough to swing the election. If 59.2 percent or more of them went for Hassan, then the election was stolen through voter fraud. That’s likely, since the surrounding states are Democrat strongholds. It’s also possible that New Hampshire’s four electoral college votes were swung to Hillary Clinton through illegal voting by nonresidents. Clinton won New Hampshire by only 2,732 votes. If 74.8 percent of the 5,513 fraudulent votes were cast for Clinton, then the presidential election in New Hampshire was tipped as well. If the presidential contest had been closer and had come down to a margin of three or four electoral college votes, then this voter fraud might have had extraordinary consequences. Regardless, in the Senate contest, it is highly likely that voting by nonresidents changed the result. And that is already having consequences for the nation. If the 52-48 Republican-Democrat balance in the Senate were 53-47, it could change the balance in any number of votes – not the least of which would be the effort to repeal Obamacare.

c57f8234,"A team of scientists from Canada have identified at least 13 strains of cannabis sativa they believe can aid in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The President of the United States of America has spent the past few weeks touting a dangerous drug called hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic treatment for COVID-19. Unfortunately, the president’s expertise is in reality TV, not medicine. Several studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine, a drug designed to treat malaria, has dangerous side-effects when used to treat coronavirus, including death. The quest for a COVID-19 drug that will both make Donald Trump and his friends in the pharmaceutical industry rich and not kill the people who take it has, so far, netted no results. But exciting government-sponsored research out of Canada seems to indicate a different approach is in order. Per the team’s research paper: “ We have developed over 800 new Cannabis sativa lines and extracts and hypothesized that high-CBD C. sativa extracts may be used to modulate ACE2 expression in COVID-19 target tissues. Screening C. sativa extracts using artificial human 3D models of oral, airway, and intestinal tissues, we identified 13 high CBD C. sativa extracts that modulate ACE2 gene expression and ACE2 protein levels. Our initial data suggest that some C. sativa extract down-regulate serine protease TMPRSS2, another critical protein required for SARS-CoV2 entry into host cells. What this means is the team has carefully developed several cannabis strains that have been experimentally shown to make it significantly more difficult for the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus to find a home inside of the tissue cells it latches onto in order to infect us with the COVID-19 disease. It does not mean you should run out to your local dispensary and exhaust their sativa and CBD supply. The 13 strains cultivated by the researchers are almost certainly very different from whatever wacky-named strains you’re going to purchase over the counter. But, if you must take an untested treatment, I recommend taking Canada‘s lead and legally imbibing cannabis instead of listening to the Trump administration. A recent study led by Harvard Medical School professor Mandeep Mehra which looked at data from more than 96,000 COVID-19 patients, 15,000 of which had been treated with hydroxychloroquine, clearly showed that patients using the drug were at far greater risk for death than those who did not. Per a report from the Washington Post: “ For those given hydroxychloroquine, there was a 34 percent increase in risk of mortality and a 137 percent increased risk of a serious heart arrhythmias. For those receiving hydroxychloroquine and an antibiotic — the cocktail endorsed by Trump — there was a 45 percent increased risk of death and a 411 percent increased risk of serious heart arrhythmias. Those given chloroquine had a 37 percent increased risk of death and a 256 percent increased risk of serious heart arrhythmias. For those taking chloroquine and an antibiotic, there was a 37 percent increased risk of death and a 301 percent increased risk of serious heart arrhythmias. Donald Trump recently told reporters and the US public that he’d been taking hydroxycholoroquine as a preventative measure to ward off COVID-19. Excepting the fact he has a small financial stake in Plaquenil – the drug name for hydroxycholoroquine — if he really wants to prevent COVID-19 he should imbibe cannabis. There’s no peer-reviewed evidence showing it’ll work, but at least it won’t kill him. Not only has no one ever died from imbibing cannabis, it has clear medical benefits for the prevention and treatment of diseases ranging from viral infections to cancer. That, and he might be less of an asshole if he smoked a joint every now and again. For more information on the cannabis study, check out the full pre-print research paper here. And if you want to know more about why nobody should use hydroxycholorquine to prevent or treat COVID-19, please read this important study. People with lung cancer are dying after being diagnosed late in A&E because their GP missed signs of the disease despite often repeated visits, experts have revealed. As many as 56% of people in some parts of England who get lung cancer are only diagnosed when they visit A&E, according to a report by the UK Lung Cancer Coalition. They are five times more likely to die within a year than those whose condition has been identified either by their GP or through the NHS cancer screening programme. Family doctors often fail to diagnose cases of lung cancer until it is too late to treat effectively or miss them altogether, leading patients to seek help at A&E, the report says. More than a third of lung cancer patients see their GP three or more times before being referred for tests. That is a key factor in the UK’s poor record, in international terms, at diagnosing the disease early. Lung cancer is the third commonest form of cancer in the UK and the biggest cancer killer, claiming 35,000 lives a year. “People diagnosed in A&E are dying as a result of delays in identifying their illness. Late diagnosis makes lung cancer harder to treat and is a major reason why we have such poor survival in the UK,” said Prof Mick Peake, chair of the coalition’s clinical advisory group. It is “a travesty” that admission to hospital as a medical emergency is the single commonest way the disease is diagnosed, added Peake, who is also the clinical director of the Centre for Cancer Outcomes at University College Hospital London. GPs’ failure to spot symptoms of lung cancer is only one reason for Britain’s low rate of early diagnosis and high rate of lung cancer mortality, Peake stressed. However, he added: “There is good evidence that there are missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis in primary care and we strongly urge GPs to have a low threshold for doing a chest X-ray or CT scan in patients where there is any suspicion of lung cancer.” Patients’ reluctance to have symptoms, such as a persistent cough, checked out can delay diagnosis too, especially those from poorer households and older people. NHS data cited by Peake shows a postcode lottery in which Tower Hamlets in east London has the highest proportion of patients whose disease is diagnosed in A&E – 56.2% – closely followed by Manchester 56.1% and Leeds south and east 54%. More than 50% of patients are also diagnosed in A&E in Salford, Hull, South Tyneside and Sunderland. In contrast, only 14.7% of sufferers in Guildford and Waverley in Surrey are diagnosed that way, with low rates also in Wokingham in Berkshire 15.7% and Harrogate 16%. Dr Moira Fraser-Pearce, director of policy, campaigns and influence at Macmillan Cancer Support, said that staff shortages in NHS cancer services and heavy workloads were exacerbating the complex reasons for the high level of diagnosis in A&E. Macmillan has helped NHS England develop a new way of screening smokers and other high-risk patients for lung cancer by offering tests in trucks, often situated in supermarket car parks. The NHS did not comment directly on the findings but a spokesperson said that: “The NHS is catching more cancers earlier when they are easier to treat, resulting in record lung cancer survival rates.” Targeted lung health checks in locations such as supermarket car parks will detect “thousands more cases of cancer that might not have been detected otherwise, saving even more lives”, they added. NHS England has pledged to diagnose three in four cases of cancer at an early stage by 2028. Currently 57% of lung cancers are diagnosed late, greatly reducing chance of survival.",fake
7d5ccffa,"Hawking says Trump's climate stance could damage Earth Global average temperatures over land have plummeted by more than 1C since the middle of this year – their biggest and steepest fall on record. The news comes amid mounting evidence that the recent run of world record high temperatures is about to end. The fall, revealed by Nasa satellite measurements of the lower atmosphere, has been caused by the end of El Nino – the warming of surface waters in a vast area of the Pacific west of Central America. Global average temperatures over land have plummeted by more than 1C since the middle of this year – their biggest and steepest fall on record Some scientists, including Dr Gavin Schmidt, head of Nasa’s climate division, have claimed that the recent highs were mainly the result of long-term global warming. Others have argued that the records were caused by El Nino, a complex natural phenomenon that takes place every few years, and has nothing to do with greenhouse gas emissions by humans. The new fall in temperatures suggests they were right. Big El Ninos always have an immense impact on world weather, triggering higher than normal temperatures over huge swathes of the world. The 2015-16 El Nino was probably the strongest since accurate measurements began, with the water up to 3C warmer than usual. It has now been replaced by a La Nina event – when the water in the same Pacific region turns colder than normal. Last week, Mr Trump’s science adviser Bob Walker said he was likely to axe Nasa’s $1.9 billion (about £1.4 billion) climate research budget This also has worldwide impacts, driving temperatures down rather than up. The satellite measurements over land respond quickly to El Nino and La Nina. Temperatures over the sea are also falling, but not as fast, because the sea retains heat for longer. This means it is possible that by some yardsticks, 2016 will be declared as hot as 2015 or even slightly hotter – because El Nino did not vanish until the middle of the year. But it is almost certain that next year, large falls will also be measured over the oceans, and by weather station thermometers on the surface of the planet – exactly as happened after the end of the last very strong El Nino in 1998. If so, some experts will be forced to eat their words. Last year, Dr Schmidt said 2015 would have been a record hot year even without El Nino. ‘The reason why this is such a warm record year is because of the long-term underlying trend, the cumulative effect of the long-term warming trend of our Earth,’ he said. This was ‘mainly caused’ by the emission of greenhouse gases by humans. Dr Schmidt also denied that there was any ‘pause’ or ‘hiatus’ in global warming between the 1998 and 2015 El Ninos. But on its website home page yesterday, Nasa featured a new study which said there was a hiatus in global warming before the recent El Nino, and discussed why this was so. Last night Dr Schmidt had not returned a request for comment. However, both his own position, and his Nasa division, may be in jeopardy. US President-elect Donald Trump is an avowed climate change sceptic, who once claimed it was a hoax invented by China. Last week, Mr Trump’s science adviser Bob Walker said he was likely to axe Nasa’s $1.9 billion (about £1.4 billion) climate research budget. The Pacific warming can trigger floods, such as those in Peru, pictured above Other experts have also disputed Dr Schmidt’s claims. Professor Judith Curry, of the Georgia Institute of Technology, and president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network, said yesterday: ‘I disagree with Gavin. The record warm years of 2015 and 2016 were primarily caused by the super El Nino.’ The slowdown in warming was, she added, real, and all the evidence suggested that since 1998, the rate of global warming has been much slower than predicted by computer models – about 1C per century. David Whitehouse, a scientist who works with Lord Lawson’s sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation, said the massive fall in temperatures following the end of El Nino meant the warming hiatus or slowdown may be coming back. ‘According to the satellites, the late 2016 temperatures are returning to the levels they were at after the 1998 El Nino.",partial
2855fe5a,"A discussion of ‘smokers’ black lungs’ started in the comments today. It’s the widespread belief that smokers’ lungs turn black. Rose pointed out that it all started with James I about four centuries ago. She also dug up some refutations: “Dr. Duane Carr – Professor of Surgery at the University of Tennessee College of Medicine, said this: “Smoking does not discolor the lung.” (link) Dr. Victor Buhler, Pathologist at St. Joseph Hospital in Kansas City: “I have examined thousands of lungs both grossly and microscopically. I cannot tell you from examining a lung whether or not its former host had smoked.” (link) Dr. Sheldon Sommers, Pathologist and Director of Laboratories at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York: “…it is not possible grossly or microscopically, or in any other way known to me, to distinguish between the lung of a smoker or a nonsmoker. Blackening of lungs is from carbon particles, and smoking tobacco does not introduce carbon particles into the lung.” (link) And Brigitte even found a Youtube video: There is even this (in German) in which a forensic medic states that these “tar” lungs do not exist. Rich White’s Smoke Screens reports the same: This was confirmed by Dr Jan Zeldenrust, a Dutch pathologist for the Government of Holland from 1951 – 1984. In a television interview in the 1980’s he stated that, translated from Dutch, “I could never see on a pair of lungs if they belonged to a smoker or non-smoker. I can see clearly the difference between sick and healthy lungs. The only black lungs I’ve seen are from peat-workers and coal miners, never from smokers”. smokers-lungs1Nevertheless, the black lungs are all over cigarette packets these days. And black lung disease (or pneumoconiosis) is a real disease. Coal miners get it. So where does the smokers’ black lung idea come from? Part of the answer can be found in a photo-essay on Medicinenet: This photo essay will focus on smoker’s lung. The term “smoker’s lung” refers to the structural and functional abnormalities (diseases) in the lung caused by cigarette smoking. First, the normal structure and function of the lung will be described and illustrated. Then, the structural and functional abnormalities caused by smoking will be described and illustrated. A bit further on the effect of emphysema on lungs is described. emphysemaAs a result, emphysema also disrupts the normal blood supply. Figure 4 contrasts the nasty appearance of a smoker’s emphysematous lung with a normal lung. So it’s emphysema that causes the nasty appearance of a smoker’s emphysematous lung. It continues: As you can imagine, cigarette smoke contains many impurities that are inhaled in great numbers directly into the lung. For this reason, the alveolar spaces of the smoker contain numerous scavenger cells (macrophages) that are filled with engulfed (phagocytized) particles of impurities and debris, as illustrated in Figure 5. Under the microscope, with this high magnification, you can actually see the black and brown engulfed particles in the alveolar scavenger cells. Indeed, smoker’s lung may have so much of this particulate material that the lung looks gray-black to the naked eye. So, most of the time, you don’t need a microscope to tell if someone is or was a heavy smoker. A naked eye examination of a smoker’s lung usually will reveal an enlarged gray-black lung with enlarged air spaces (the emphysema, as you saw in Figure 4 and will see again in Figure 8). I’m not sure why people are asked to ‘imagine’ what’s in tobacco smoke. But since the emphysematous lung has simply been renamed the ‘smoker’s lung’, maybe it’s necessary to explain why it’s turned grey-black. And it’s that imaginary stuff in tobacco smoke that is conjured up to explain it. The lie hinges on first asserting that smoking causes emphysema (it may do, or it may not), and secondly asserting that emphysema turns lungs grey-black (it probably does), and then finally dropping the connecting middle term of ’emphysema’,  and asserting that smoking turns lungs grey-black. Or it’s just calling emphysematous lungs ‘smokers’ lungs’. A parallel false ascription might be found elsewhere. People who visit Delhi may get food poisoning from ingesting bacteria. The food poisoning may cause vomiting and so on. But if the ‘bacteria’ link is missed out, and the malady is just called ‘Delhi belly’ (as it often is), it may mislead people into believing that it’s visiting Delhi (or Indian restaurants) which is the root of the trouble – although in fact most visitors to Delhi (and Indian restaurants) don’t suffer such ill-effects, and there are lots of other places in the world other than Delhi where you can contract ‘Delhi belly’. It’s a thoroughly dishonest and disreputable mis-attribution of a disease. It pins the disease on a particular social group: smokers. And it makes it their disease, and nobody else’s – even though not everyone who gets emphysema is a smoker, and not all smokers get emphysema. But at least we may now see why pathologists aren’t finding grey-black smokers’ lungs: they didn’t have emphysema. But this doesn’t seem to be the only way the black lung lie is propagated. There are also the pigs’ lungs used in demonstrations. I even found an ad for one: The accompanying text helpfully explains: The inflatable swine lungs have been stained realistically and then specially preserved by the BioFlex odorless, nontoxic process that retains the texture and elasticity of fresh lungs. The lungs dramatically and unforgettably demonstrate the effects of prolonged smoking. A palpable simulated internal tumor and a physical simulated external tumor encourage students to feel the texture of the lungs, and to remember that smoking is a known cause of lung cancer. So firstly they’re pig lungs. And secondly they’ve been preserved and stained realistically. And simulated internal and external tumours have been added. And all to demonstrate the effects of prolonged smoking!  It beggars belief. No doubt the students aren’t told any of this, and are led to believe that they’re looking at real human ‘smokers’ lungs’. There are even discussions of the effectiveness of such imagery. Marketing researchers at the University of Arkansas, Villanova University and Marquette University surveyed more than 500 U.S. and Canadian smokers and found that the highly graphic images of the negative consequences of smoking have the greatest impact on smokers’ intentions to quit. The most graphic images, such as those showing severe mouth diseases, including disfigured, blackened and cancerous tissue, evoked fear about the consequences of smoking and thus influenced consumer intentions to quit. “These results suggest that there appears to be little downside on intentions to quit from using extremely graphic pictorial depictions of the negative health outcomes due to smoking,” said Scot Burton, co-author of the study and marketing professor in the Sam M. Walton College of Business. In fact, there may be a downside from using such graphic images, if they have been fraudulently obtained (a consideration which doesn’t appear to have crossed the minds of the marketing researchers). And we’ve just established two methods by which they are fraudulently obtained. And the downside is that, when it is shown that they’re fraudulent, the people who publish them will be accused of fraud, of twisting logic and manufacturing evidence. And when that happens, people will cease to believe not just the fraudulent evidence they have produced, but everything else that they assert too. They will lose all their credibility. Nobody will believe a word they say. That’s quite a big downside, I think. And it’s a downside that doesn’t even seem to have occurred to them. It doesn’t seem to have occurred to the mass media that help propagate these lies that people will cease to believe a word they say either. Nor does it seem to have occurred to the medical profession which allows these lies to be propagated unchallenged that people will cease to believe them too. There’s an awful lot of downside waiting to go down. TIJUANA, Mexico — It’s the image from the unfolding crisis in Tijuana seen around the world: a migrant mom and her young children running away from a smoking tear gas canister with barbed wire and a forbidding metal wall in the background. Both children are clad only in T-shirts, and one appears to be wearing a pull-up diaper. One child is barefoot, another wears flip-flops. The woman clutching their arms and dragging them out of harm's way is wearing black leggings and a T-shirt emblazoned with the smiling cartoon faces of the Anna and Elsa from the Disney movie Frozen. That jarring portrait was captured on camera Sunday by veteran Reuters photographer Kim Kyung-Hoon moments after a group of Central American migrants approached the border crossing into San Diego and were forced backwards by tear gas canisters hurled by U.S. border agents. When the tear gas started, some people were screaming and everybody started running away,” Kim told NBC News on Monday. I saw the woman and two children running away. One girl was barefoot from the beginning. The other was wearing beach sandals and lost them in the chaos. NBC News also tracked down the woman, Maria Mesa, a 39-year-old mother of five from Honduras, inside a tent at the Benito Juarez Shelter in Tijuana. I grabbed my children and ran, Mesa said of her 5-year-old twin daughters Saira and Sheilly. Mesa said her 3-year-old son James, who does not appear in the picture, was also with them and fainted after getting a lung-full of gas. One of them could have died, she said. Kim said Mesa was travelling with five children. Their father lives in Louisiana and they are trying to reach him, he said. Kim's photograph, which appeared on the NBC News website and on the front pages of numerous newspapers, provoked worldwide outrage and appeared to make a lie of President Donald Trump’s claim that the caravans were an invading force of criminals and gang members. But Trump defended tear-gassing the migrants, calling them some very tough people. Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries.

The latest assignment began for Kim on Nov. 14 when he arrived in Mexico City and began following the migrant caravans escaping the terror in the home countries and heading north for the American border. On Sunday, the group Kim had been shadowing was at the El Chaparral border crossing and the U.S. was in sight. Reuters photographer Kim Kyung-Hoon works in Minamisoma, Japan, on April 11, 2011. Minamisoma is a city 11 miles away from the Fukushima nuclear power station that was hit by an earthquake and tsunami. Kim Kyung-Hoon / Reuters file They were stopped at one spot by the Mexican police, the photographer said. Then they climbed down the river bank. The wire fence was on the other side of the river about 20 meters away. Kim said he watched as the mother and the twins started fording the shallow river at the border. Asked if that was why the girls were wearing next to nothing, the photographer said he believes that was all the clothing they had. For a few seconds, Kim said, he was distracted by two men who had already made it across and were using their bare hands and a bucket to dig a hole under a fence so they could crawl under. Then, suddenly, the air was filled with choking smoke. One canister fell by the family and they started running away, he said, referring to the mother and twins. Migrants ride on the back of a truck while making their way to Tijuana from Mexicali, Mexico, on Nov. 20. Kim Kyung-Hoon / Reuters Kim said he could hear the little girls coughing and crying and he immediately aimed his camera in their direction and starting shooting the unfolding chaos. He said he stayed with them as they fled back to the migrant encampment. Asked if he was rattled by what he witnessed and the heartbreaking sounds of children crying, Kim said my job is to document what is happening. I try not to let my emotions get involved in my work, he said. CORRECTION (Nov. 27, 2018, 7:50 a.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the children in the photograph.

ccfaeb64,"Scientists caught 'adjusting' sea level data to create false impression of rising oceans Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017 — a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month. Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline. Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas. In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida’s request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017. A spokesperson for Florida’s Department of Children and Families (DCF) — the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida — confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program. “The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the state’s administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program,” said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims. Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3. The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters. But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce. The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further. Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.",partial
3552384d,"Vladimir Putin condemns Europe’s handling of migrants In Miami Beach, the city engineer, Bruce A. Mowry, has come up with a plan for combating the flooding. He rips up problematic streets, raises them with extra dirt and repaves them, installing new drains and giant pumps that can push water back into the bay. The approach has already been shown to work in several neighborhoods. A controversy has erupted about whether Miami Beach is polluting Biscayne Bay with the water, but the city is pushing ahead. Miami Beach plans to spend at least $400 million on its plan by 2018, raising the money through fees imposed on homes and businesses. The huge county government for the region, Miami-Dade County, is developing its own resilience strategy, one likely to cost billions. It has committed to rebuilding some of its decaying infrastructure, like a sewage plant, in a way that safeguards against sea-level rise and storm surges. “I don’t see doom and gloom here; I see opportunity,” said Harvey Ruvin, the clerk of courts for Miami-Dade County, who has been a leading voice on the environment in Florida for a half-century, and who recently led a county task force on sea-level rise. “We’re talking about the most robust possible jobs program you can think of, and one that can’t be outsourced.” Many of the Republican mayors in the region are on the same page as Democrats in requesting national and state action on climate change, as well as pushing local steps. James C. Cason, the Republican mayor of Coral Gables, has convened informational sessions that draw hundreds of residents, and he has received no complaints for his stance. “I hope in coming years when we have to spend a lot of money, the citizens will still support it,” Mr. Cason said in an interview. Still, his city, and others in South Florida, have some hard decisions to make. Some property owners cannot afford to raise their sea walls, putting their neighborhoods at increased risk of flooding. Will they be held legally responsible when floods do occur? A strict policy could force some people from their homes. Conversely, should public money be spent to do the work, even if it largely benefits private property?",truth
64d89844,"Devon town is best place to live to take kids on holiday COLUMBUS, Ohio - This July, Ohio will begin tracking arsonists through a new registry similar to the one used to track sex offenders. The law, passed by the Ohio General Assembly late last year without much attention, will require people convicted of arson-related offenses to register at their local sheriff's office each year for at least 10 years. Those who fail to register will be charged with a felony. Supporters tout the measure as another tool for law enforcement in investigating the difficult-to-solve crime. But critics argue the registry will be burdensome, and that arson is not a significant enough problem in Ohio to warrant an official registry, especially one that is kept from the public's eyes. There is a huge problem with arson in Ohio, said Sen. Tim Schaffer, a Lancaster Republican who sponsored the bill. With the registry, law enforcement can look up who all the convicted arsonists are, who have done their time and are back at home or back in the community. Chances are good that it's a repeat offender, and you already know who . . . it might be. Last year, 8,377 suspicious fires were reported, which resulted in more than $160 million in estimated damages, according to the Ohio State Fire Marshal. There are approximately 500 convictions of arson each year, according to the Buckeye State Sheriff's Association. I don't know where it came from, Amy Borror, spokeswoman for the Ohio Public Defender's Office, said of the new law. I don't know why we have it. Borror said the law will put unnecessary work on the shoulders of local sheriffs, who will be tasked with compiling the list in addition to the sex-offender registry they already put together. The sex-offender registry has been around for a long time, and the research that's out there says that it has no positive impact on the public safety, Borror said. And, if anything, it might have a negative impact on public safety because it creates this administrative burden. Nick Worner, spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union, said a registry for arson seems arbitrary and will do little to solve crimes because rounding up the usual suspects is rarely an effective investigation method. Are we eventually going to have a registry for everything? Worner said. Will we have a shoplifters registry, where if something comes up missing at JC Penney's, they round up everybody who has ever been convicted of shoplifting and start there? Generally, the problem with this sort of thing is that it's supposed to start with the gathering of evidence in the investigation and then the detaining of people based on suspicion. This kind of does that backwards. Worner also expressed concern that money needed to maintain the registry may end up coming from taxpayers' pockets. He said fees paid by offenders are supposed to finance registries, but that does not necessarily mean they will make the payments. Another big concern, Worner said, is that unlike the sex-offender registry, this one is not publicly available, meaning only law enforcement has access to the list. I think we would argue there is an issue with gathering this information in the first place, but it's an important question to ask: If you have to exempt the information from public-records law, should you be gathering it in the first place? Worner asked. Borror noted that the sex-offender registry has errors and inconsistencies, and the arsonist list will remain unchecked by the public, leaving many potential problems unaddressed. Schaffer said the list will not be public because arson-related crimes are very different from sex offenses, and he has received no demand to make the list public. I haven't had one member of the public ask me for access to this law-enforcement tool, Schaffer said. It's a law-enforcement tool. It's for the same reason that you can't access the state of Ohio's database for people's license plates. What's the purpose? He said providing the registry to the public is not off the table, but Ohioans would have to express a desire to see the list. Robert Cornwell, executive director of the Buckeye State Sheriff's Association, said he was pleased with the new law, which he said should provide new techniques for arson investigators. Cornwell said his organization approves of the registry because police should know the whereabouts of convicted arsonists. He did not estimate a much-larger workload for sheriffs in compiling the registry. Michael Duchesne, spokesman for the State Fire Marshal, also expressed support of the registry, saying it will afford law enforcement more options when investigating arson-related crimes. He said there are enough suspicious fires in Ohio to necessitate the registry. Worner, with the ACLU, said even if the list is a new tool for law enforcement, it will not prove crimes. Ohioans should worry about the precedent the arson registry may create, he said. You have to look down the road, Worner said. If there's a registry here and a registry here, what's next?",partial

ad333c3f,"Profile: Seal Team Six Theresa May's hopes of winning a landslide Election victory suffered a major blow last night after her poll lead plummeted to 11 per cent amid the row over her tax and pension plans. A Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday put the Conservatives on 40 per cent, followed by Labour on 29 per cent and the Lib Dems and Ukip level on 11 per cent. It means Mrs May’s lead over Jeremy Corbyn has nearly halved in four days: a poll immediately after she called the Election gave the Tories a 21-point advantage. A poll for the Mail on Sunday put the Conservatives on 40 per cent, followed by Labour on 29 per cent. It comes after backlash against the threat to drop pledges not to increase tax and to guarantee a minimum 2.5 per cent annual rise in pensions Polling expert Professor John Curtice said the Survation figures would give Mrs May a Commons majority of 46, an improvement on her current working majority of 17, but way below some forecasts of a 140-seat majority. The Conservative slump follows the threat to drop existing pledges not to increase tax and to guarantee a minimum 2.5 per cent annual rise in pensions. The backlash was further fuelled by Mrs May’s surprise announcement that she will not abandon the Party’s controversial promise to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid. The Mail on Sunday poll is the only one to have been conducted after all three stories broke, and shows voters are less likely to vote Tory as a result. The Prime Minister spurned three opportunities yesterday to contradict claims that she will drop David Cameron’s 2015 Election pledge not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT until 2020. Put on the spot repeatedly at an election hustings in Dudley, West Midlands, she avoided giving a direct answer, merely stressing the Tories were a party of ‘low taxation’. Mr Corbyn immediately promised to protect pensions. Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked a tax scare, saying it was ‘self-evidently clear that the commitments in the 2015 manifesto strain the Government’s ability to manage the economy flexibly’ She said: ‘People are going to have a very clear election choice between a Conservative Party which always has been and will continue to be a party that believes in lower taxes. Or Labour, whose natural instinct is to always raise taxes.’ The Tory turmoil came after Mrs May refused to say she would stick to the so-called pensions ‘triple lock’ when questioned in her Maidenhead constituency on Friday. And Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked a tax scare, saying it was ‘self-evidently clear that the commitments in the 2015 manifesto strain the Government’s ability to manage the economy flexibly.’ Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell immediately called Mr Hammond’s statement a ‘Tory tax bombshell’, hijacking the Tories’ former slogan against Labour. 42 per cent said a Tory landslide would be ‘good’ for Britain with 36 per cent against. Former Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt accused her of ‘an attempted power grab Tory MPs refused to comment publicly for fear of upsetting the party’s chances of success on June 8. However, privately, they were deeply critical. ‘It is an very untidy start to our campaign,’ said one. ‘Someone needs to get hold of our message – and fast. This is not the way to win votes.’ Former Tory Chancellor Norman Lamont said: ‘I think Phillip Hammond is just trying to get some flexibility back into the system, although whether he was wise to say it is a different matter. ‘It is pretty ironic for Labour, of all people, to be using the “tax bombshell” line’. Senior Tory sources insisted ‘no final decision’ had been made on the Party’s manifesto stance on pensions and tax. Labour and the Lib Dems seized on the confusion. Mr Corbyn immediately promised to protect pensions, and former Lib Dem Cabinet Minister Vince Cable said: ‘Mr Hammond admitted taxes would have to rise, no doubt due to Mrs May’s hard Brexit that could leave a £100 billion black hole in the public finances. 'You can’t have a strong economy and a hard Brexit.’ Asked in the poll if Mrs May’s refusal to rule out ending the pensions guarantee would affect their vote, 28 per cent said they were less likely to vote Tory, against 17 per cent who were more likely. Mr Hammond’s refusal to rule out raising tax prompted a similar negative response. And 34 per cent said refusing to cut overseas aid would make them less likely to vote Conservative. Only 13 per cent said they were more likely. former Lib Dem Cabinet Minister Vince Cable said: 'You can’t have a strong economy and a hard Brexit.’ Mrs May was yesterday branded a ‘political opportunist’ by the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator over the snap Election The tax row comes just weeks after Hammond was forced to scrap plans to increase national insurance for the self-employed amid uproar over the effect on ‘white van man’ and the fact that it breached the 2015 manifesto vow on tax rises. Despite the sharply reduced lead, voters appear relaxed by the prospect of a Tory landslide. A total of 42 per cent said it would be ‘good’ for Britain with 36 per cent against. There was more Tory confusion last night as Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen claimed a ‘senior Government figure’ had told him the Party manifesto would include a commitment to scrap the controversial High Speed 2 train link to Birmingham. Downing Street sources denied the claim. And Mrs May was yesterday branded a ‘political opportunist’ by the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator over the snap Election. Former Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt accused her of ‘an attempted power grab... before the reality of Brexit bites’.

We have received a number of calls regarding how to enter security information for a baby that has not yet been born, Shafer wrote. Crazy as it may sound, you MUST include the baby in the overall count of guests in the tour. It’s an easy process. The newsletter then proceeds to spell out how the baby’s security information should be entered into the White House system, including such details as: GENDER: if the parents know put that gender down if not, you can enter either M or F as we’ll ask you to update it at the time of birth. All of the information should be updated once, the baby is born, the newsletter instructs. It is ironic that President Obama's staff recognizes the existence of unborn babies for purposes of providing security within the White House -- yet, there is no indication that President Obama has any problem with the fact that throughout the District of Columbia, abortion is now legal for any reason up to the moment of birth,” said Douglas Johnson, National Right to Life legislative director. “Notably, the newsletter provides no guidance on what the staff should do if an unborn baby is first registered for security purposes, but then aborted. On May 17, the House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee plans to hold a hearing on the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 3803), which would generally prohibit abortion in the sixth month and later in the District. If the President wants to provide for the security of the unborn child immediately outside of the White House gates, as well as inside, he should endorse this bill. Further information on the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is available on the NRLC website at http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/Fetal_Pain/index.html Founded in 1968, the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC), the federation of 50 state right-to-life affiliates and more than 3,000 local chapters, is the nation's oldest and largest grassroots pro-life organization.

Prior to the film beginning principal photography in a matter of months, one dedicated fan artist has crafted the trippiest piece of Doctor Strange fan art we've seen. If we've got to be honest, we're not sure if anything else can get us as excited for the movie as this poster. Shared to Instagram by fan artist @sethtember, the poster takes the trippiness of what we've seen in Doctor Strange and takes it to a whole new level. Featuring the Time Stone and the Eye of Agamatto, the post includes Cumberbatch's Sorcerer Supreme in various forms. The background includes some Dark Dimension-esque effects that make it looks as if time and reality are folding in on itself. All in all, it's totally on-brand for the character. See it for yourself below. Despite being hit with some massive pre-production changes, reports suggest the film is still on track to meet its release date. It's been said the movie will be the first scary movie within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, something Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige previously compared to Raiders of the Lost Ark. “I mean, there are horrifying sequences in Raiders that I as a little kid would [cover my eyes] when their faces melted. Or Temple of Doom, of course, or Gremlins, or Poltergeist,” Feige said. “These are the movies that invented the PG-13 rating, by the way. They were PG and then they were like, ‘We need another [rating].’ But that’s fun. It’s fun to be scared in that way, and not a horrific, torturous way, but a way that is legitimately scary — because Scott Derrickson is quite good at that — but scary in the service of an exhilarating emotion. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is due out May 7, 2021. Other upcoming Marvel Studios projects include Black Widow on May 1st, The Falcon and The Winter Soldier in Fall of 2020, The Eternals on November 6th, WandaVision in 2020, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings on February 12, 2021, Loki in Spring 2021, Spider-Man 3 on July 16, 2021, What If…? in Summer 2021, Hawkeye in Fall 2021, Thor: Love and Thunder on November 5, 2021, and Black Panther 2 on May 6, 2022.",fake

Critics have called the bill unnecessary or valuing religion over secularism… WKRC reports: The Ohio House on Wednesday passed the “Student Religious Liberties Act.” Under the law, students can’t be penalized if their work is scientifically wrong as long as the reasoning is because of their religious beliefs. Reporting on the new bill, Cleveland.com notes: If public school students turn in work saying the earth is only 10,000 years old, they cannot be penalized under Ohio House Bill 164 if its their religious beliefs. House Bill 164, known as the Ohio Student Religious Liberties Act of 2019, entails the following: Requires public schools to give students the same access to facilities if they want to meet for religious expression as they’d give secular groups. Removes a provision that allows school districts to limit religious expression to lunch periods or other non-instructional times. Allows students to engage in religious expression before, during and after school hours to the same extent as a student in secular activities or expression. Prohibits schools from restricting a student from engaging in religious expression in completion of homework, artwork and other assignments. In short, the proposed Ohio law would allow students to substitute religious dogma for science, and would not allow teachers to penalize students for giving wrong answers as long as those answers are based on the student’s religious beliefs. House Bill 164 passed by a vote of 61-3. Every Republican in the House supported the bill. It now moves to the Republican-controlled Senate. Bottom line: The Ohio House has passed legislation that would allow students to give wrong answers and not be penalized if those wrong answers are based on the student’s “sincerely held religious belief.”",fake
7be6b208,"Scottish Parliament should return to business, say Tories Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday that former Vice President Joe Biden is considering forgiving $50,000 in federal student loan debt for every borrower with an annual salary of under $125,000 — a move that would place an incredibly heavy burden on taxpayers. More than 40 million Americans currently have outstanding federal loans, amounting to a whopping total of $1.54 trillion in debt. What did he say? We have come to the conclusion that President Biden can undo this debt, can forgive $50,000 of debt the first day he becomes president, Schumer announced to supporters outside of his New York office. You don't need Congress; all you need is the flick of a pen. I have told him how important it is. He is considering it, Schumer added after a reporter asked if he had spoken to Biden about the proposal. We believe he does [have the executive authority], and he's researching that. I believe that when he does his research, he will find that he does. During the 2020 Democratic primary, Biden expressed support for a Democratic legislative proposal that would immediately cancel up to $10,000 in debt for each borrower. But since then, progressives in the party have been urging the former vice president to bypass Congress and cancel the debt by executive fiat. Whether it is constitutional for a president to take such an action remains in question. What else? Later during the event, a reporter pressed Schumer on the equity of debt cancelation. What about the families that have made sacrifices to pay off the student loans for their students? What about the students who have paid off their student loans? the reporter asked. Look, Schumer responded, lots of students paid off student loans, but it's such a burden it's good for everybody to make sure this debt is vanquished. After the event had concluded, one of individuals standing next to Schumer, mocked the reporter's question, brushing it off as just the Fox News perspective on the issue. These people have great futures, but they are burdened by debt ... we want to remove it, Schumer had plainly stated during the event. Yet, despite Schumer's portrayal of debt cancelation as an obvious, kind solution, in reality, it is far from either. As TheBlaze previously reported, contrary to what progressive politicians claim, 'canceling debt' is not something that actually exists. Lawmakers could remove a borrower's liability for re-paying the debt, but the debt will be shifted onto someone and in the case of federal student loans, the burden would be further shifted onto taxpayers.",other

Scientists studying Antarctica sea ice warn a rise in accumulation could spark an ice age. Computer simulations show that an explosion of sea ice would block the ocean from exchanging carbon dioxide with the atmosphere Computer simulations show that an explosion in ice circling the frozen desert would act as a lid on the ocean and block it from exchanging carbon dioxide with the atmosphere. This is capable of causing a reverse greenhouse effect, which would ultimately cool the earth and send our planet into an ice age for the first time in over two million years. The last major ice age is believed to have ended about 2.5 million years ago during the Pleistocene era. Since then, glaciers have periodically covered the earth, but then retreated and experts have now set out to understand the process behind an ice age — how it works and what triggers it. The latest study was conducted by a team at the University of Chicago who set out to discover and understand the processes that makeup global climate. Assistant professor Malte Jansen at the University of Chicago (UChicago) said, ‘One key question in the field is still what caused the Earth to periodically cycle in and out of ice ages.’ ‘We are pretty confident that the carbon balance between the atmosphere and ocean must have changed, but we don’t quite know how or why.’ This event is capable of causing a reverse greenhouse effect, which would ultimately cool the earth and send our planet into an ice age for the first time in over two million years Jansen and former UChicago postdoctoral researcher Alice Marzocchi developed computer simulations of Antarctica sea ice and found it not only changes ocean circulation but acts as a lid and blocks it from releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere – the less carbon in the air, the cooler the planet becomes. ‘What this suggests is that it’s a feedback loop,’ said Marzocchi, now a research scientist at the UK’s National Oceanography Center. ‘As the temperature drops, less carbon is released into the atmosphere, which triggers more cooling.’ The explanation fits with evidence about the past climate from sources like sediments, coral reefs, and core samples from glaciers. ‘What surprised me is how much of this increased storage can be attributed to physical changes alone, with Antarctic sea-ice cover being the key player,’ Marzocchi said.",fake

03963580,"Enemies Of APC Sponsoring Boko Haram Insurgency, Banditry –Katsina Governor, Masari The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has yet again been caught exaggerating ‘global warming’ by fiddling with the raw temperature data. This time, that data concerns the recent record-breaking cold across the northeastern U.S. which NOAA is trying to erase from history. If you believe NOAA’s charts, there was nothing particularly unusual about this winter’s cold weather which caused sharks to freeze in the ocean and iguanas to drop out of trees. Here is NOAA’s January 2018 chart for Northeast U.S. – an area which includes New England along with NY, PA, NJ, DE and MD. You’d never guess from it that those regions had just experienced record-breaking cold, would you? That’s because, as Paul Homewood has discovered, NOAA has been cooking the books. Yet again – presumably for reasons more to do with ideology than meteorology – NOAA has adjusted past temperatures to look colder than they were and recent temperatures to look warmer than they were. We’re not talking fractions of a degree, here. The adjustments amount to a whopping 3.1 degrees F. This takes us well beyond the regions of error margins or innocent mistakes and deep into the realm of fiction and political propaganda. Homewood first smelt a rat when he examined the New York data sets. He was particularly puzzled at NOAA’s treatment of the especially cold winter that ravaged New York in 2013/14, which he describes here: The cold weather really began on Jan 2nd, when an Arctic front descended across much of the country, and extended well into March. The NWS wrote at the end of the winter: The winter of 2013-14 finished as one of the coldest winters in recent memory for New York State. Snowfall across Western and North Central New York was above normal for many areas, and in some locations well above normal. This winter comes on the heels of two previous mild winters, making the cold and snow this winter feel that much harsher. Temperatures this winter finished below normal every month, and the January through March timeframe finished at least 4 degrees below normal for the two primary climate stations of Western New York (Buffalo and Rochester)….. Relentless cold continued through the month of January across the region. So why, he wondered, did NOAA have this marked down as only the 30th coldest winter (since 1895) on its New York State charts, with a mean temperature of 16.9F? Homewood compared the local records for January 1943 and January 2014 – months which, according to NOAA’s charts, had very similar average temperatures. What he found was that NOAA’s charts were deeply inaccurate. The 2014 local temperatures had been adjusted upwards by NOAA and the 1943 local temperatures downwards. He concludes: On average the mean temperatures in Jan 2014 were 2.7F less than in 1943. Yet, according to NOAA, the difference was only 0.9F. Somehow, NOAA has adjusted past temperatures down, relatively, by 1.8F. Now, Homewood has given the same treatment to the most recent Big Freeze – the winter of 2017/2018. Yet again, he has found that NOAA’s arbitrary adjustments tell a lie. They claim that January 2018 was warmer in the New York region than January 1943, when the raw data from local stations tells us this just isn’t true. So at the three sites of Ithaca, Auburn and Geneva, we find that January 2018 was colder than January 1943 by 1.0, 1.7 and 1.3F respectively. Yet NOAA say that the division was 2.1F warmer last month. NOAA’s figure makes last month at least 3.1F warmer in comparison with 1943 than the actual station data warrants. He concludes: Clearly NOAA’s highly homogenised and adjusted version of the Central Lakes temperature record bears no resemblance at all the the actual station data. And if this one division is so badly in error, what confidence can there be that the rest of the US is any better? Well indeed. The key point here is that while NOAA frequently makes these adjustments to the raw data, it has never offered a convincing explanation as to why they are necessary. Nor yet, how exactly their adjusted data provides a more accurate version of the truth than the original data. One excuse NOAA’s apologists make is that weather stations are subject to changing environmental conditions. For example, when the station sited at Syracuse in 1929 was located at what was originally just a sparse aerodrome. Since then, however, as Homewood notes, it has grown into a large international airport with two runways servicing two million passengers a year. Its weather station readings therefore will certainly have been corrupted by the Urban Heat Island effect: that is, its temperature readings will have been artificially elevated by the warmth from the surrounding development and aircraft engines. So you’d think, wouldn’t you, that to compensate for this NOAA would adjust the recent temperatures downwards. Instead, for no obvious reasons, it has adjusted them upwards. This is a scandal. NOAA’s climate gatekeepers are political activists not honest scientists and the U.S. taxpayer has no business funding their propaganda. Drain the swamp!",other

While much data is gleaned in the minutiae, very little attention is given to the interrelationship between disciplines. While a medical student may become a true specialist in their field, they too become compartmentalized, and are often ignorant of very important information that would be essential for a broader, more holistic overview. And this appears to be by design.  advertisement - learn more A case in point is the testimony of Tetyana Obukhanych, who earned her Ph.D. in Immunology at the Rockefeller University in New York and did post-graduate work at Harvard. In a presentation she delivered in British Columbia (full video here), she was discussing scientific evidence from a publication dealing with a measles outbreak in Quebec in 2011. The evidence showed that 48% of those who had contracted measles were fully vaccinated for measles, and this does not even include those who were vaccinated only once for the measles, as they get lumped in with the unvaccinated people. She took a moment to tell a story about how she became aware of this phenomenon: The interesting thing is that my field, the field of immunology, the basic field that sort of is responsible for all these theories of immunity, we don’t really deal with the real world. We do research in labs. We are sort of an ivory tower profession and we don’t even read these publications because this is too far away from our field. We only read what’s specific to our research and usually it’s immunizations and how antibodies are generated and all the details of the immune responses. And I went through my whole PhD training and I believed that vaccines give you immunity and that if you got vaccines there is absolutely no way, virtually no way, that you would get a disease, and I’m pretty sure that most of my colleagues in my narrow field believed the same way, and we had conversations about that. And even someone at some point mentioned to me and said that they had a vaccine and they got measles and I sort of brushed it aside and thought that the person is confused. It was either she didn’t have the vaccine or it wasn’t measles, one of the two. But what happen is that a few years ago I had to apply for American citizenship and part of the procedure is to submit your vaccination records, right, and this was the first time that I looked at my own vaccination records carefully, and I discovered that I had two measles vaccines in my childhood. Well, I didn’t know about it because I was too young to remember, but what I remember really well is that when I was 11 I had measles, and so that was a little bit harder to discount. And I told recently someone else and they said, ‘Oh, you are confused about that, you didn’t have measles!’ like ‘How do you know?’ ‘Did you check <whether> you really had the virus there or not?’ So it’s just, you know, the doctors diagnosis, right? But I lived in Ukraine, and there, you know, there was tons of measles around and doctors knew when they saw measles. But anyway, so the reason I kind of had to look for these papers is to actually to confirm to myself whether I’m confused about my measles or is this a general phenomenon and it’s happening, and it’s documented in the literature. And indeed it is documented in the literature. But immunologists don’t know about it. Let that sink in for a moment. You get your PhD in Immunology, and you leave school to go out into the world to work on things like, oh, immunization, and you haven’t learned that you can still get certain diseases even if you’ve been fully vaccinated against them? Despite this being scientifically documented and an uncontested fact? Again, ignorance by design. Unvaccinated Children Pose No Risk To Anyone, Says Harvard Immunologist",fake

The reports come from NHS Digital England only and the Office for National Statistics. The ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey shows that in Great Britain in 2017, an estimated 29.2 million adults said they had drunk alcohol in the week before they were asked. England had the highest proportion of adults who said they drank alcohol in the previous week 57.8%, followed by Scotland 53.5% and then Wales 50.0%; of the English regions, among consumers of alcohol, binge drinking was more common in the north-west and least common in the south-east. How much people drink varies with age. A fifth of people said they did not drink at all. They were most likely to be between 25 and 64. Those most likely to drink were over 65. When the young drink, they are the most likely to binge on Friday and Saturday nights and then not drink for the rest of the week. Data from previous years in the Health Survey for England showed the most harmful drinking was among middle-aged people, who were more likely to drink every day. “Middle-class drinkers are unlikely to pay attention to government health warnings as they may be less likely to get excessively drunk, and can withstand increases in prices,” said Steve Clarke, an alcohol addiction therapy services manager with the Priory Group. “The over-45s particularly are drinking more regularly but not thinking they’re in danger. But they are drinking four, five, six days a week and it all adds up. In 2016-17 [in England] there were 337,000 estimated hospital admissions attributable to alcohol – that’s a jump of 17%, nearly a fifth, on 2006-07,” he said. The data was published on Tuesday, the day Scotland introduces minimum unit pricing after a long fight with the alcohol industry, which challenged its legality in the courts. The ONS findings support other evidence that price is a big factor in people’s drinking habits. Campaigners and experts hope minimum unit pricing will lead people, especially the most vulnerable, to forgo the strongest drinks because they will become more expensive. They are lobbying for England to follow Scotland’s example. “The Westminster government should now follow Scotland’s lead and introduce MUP in England,” said Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 organisations. “Cheap alcohol is wrecking lives and livelihoods in England as well as Scotland. There are more than 23,000 deaths a year in England linked to alcohol, and many of these come from the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society.” He added: “Minimum unit pricing will save lives, cut crime and benefit the public finances. At the same time, pub prices will be left untouched, and moderate drinkers will barely notice the difference under MUP. “Any delay in implementing MUP in England will only cost lives and lead to unnecessary alcohol-related harm. We urge the Westminster government to act now.” Minimum unit pricing sets the lowest price at which a unit of alcohol can be sold, which in Scotland is now 50p. A pint of beer containing two units will now have to cost at least £1, and a bottle of wine containing nine units will have to cost at least £4.50. But the biggest impact will be on the very strong ciders and other strong alcoholic drinks that have been very cheap and are often bought by alcoholics.",other
48eec6b0,"The global land and ocean temperature departure from average for May 2018 was the fourth highest for the month of May in the NOAA global temperature dataset record, which dates back to 1880. The March-May and year-to-date global temperatures were also the fourth warmest such periods on record.This monthly summary, developed by scientists at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides to government, business, academia and the public to support informed decision-making. May 2018 Temperature The May temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.44°F above the 20th century average of 58.6°F and the fourth highest for May in the 1880-2018 record. The years 2014-2018 rank among the five warmest Mays on record, with 2016 the warmest May at 1.58°F above average. May 2018 also marks the 42nd consecutive May and the 401st consecutive month with temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th century average. Record warmth was observed across parts of North America., Europe and Asia as well as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Record cold May temperatures were limited to northeastern Canada and the northern Atlantic Ocean, off the southern coast of Greenland. The May globally averaged land surface temperature was 2.05°F above the 20th century average of 52.0°F. This value was the smallest May temperature departure from average since 2011 and tied with 2013 as the seventh highest May land temperature in the 139-year record. The most notable warm land temperature departures from average during May 2018 were present across much of the contiguous U.S. and Europe, where temperatures were 5.4°F above average or higher. In contrast, the most notable cool land temperature departures from average were present across northeastern Canada and central Russia where temperatures were 5.4°F below average or lower. Europe had its warmest May since continental records began in 1910 at 4.97°F above average, surpassing the previous record set in 2003 by 1.66°F. May 2018 marked the first time in May that the continental temperature departure from average was 3.6°F (2.0°C) or higher. Several European countries had a record or near-record warm May temperature. Asia had its smallest May temperature departure from average since 2009. The May globally averaged sea surface temperature was 1.19°F above the 20th century monthly average of 61.3°F – also the fourth highest global ocean temperature for May in the record. The years 2014-2018 rank among the five warmest Mays on record, with 2016 the warmest May at 1.39°F above average. May 2018 Sea Ice. The May average Arctic sea ice extent was the second smallest in the 40-year record at 420,000 square miles (8.1 percent) below the 1981-2010 average, according to an analysis by the National Snow and Ice Data Center(link is external) using data from NOAA and NASA. Only the May Arctic sea ice extent in 2016 was smaller. The near-record low Arctic sea ice extent was mostly due to much-below-average sea ice in the Bering and Chukchi Seas. Antarctic sea ice extent during May was 330,000 square miles (8.6 percent) below the 1981-2010 average, the third smallest May extent on record. Antarctic sea ice expanded at a rate faster than average during May, with below-average ice coverage continuing for parts of the Weddell Sea. Seasonal (March-May 2018). The March-May average temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.48°F above the 20th century average of 56.7°F and the fourth highest for March-May in the 1880-2018 record. This value was 0.45°F cooler than the record high set in 2016 and was the smallest March-May temperature departure from average since 2014. Record warm temperatures during the three-month period were present across parts of southern Europe, the Middle East, northeastern Africa, China, Mongolia, South America and the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. No land or ocean areas had record cold temperatures during March-May 2018. The globally averaged land surface temperature for March-May was 2.34°F above the 20th century average of 46.4°F. This value was the the fifth highest for March-May in the 139-year record. Five continents had a March-May 2018 temperature that ranked among the nine warmest such period since continental records began in 1910. Of note, Europe and South America had their third warmest March-May on record. The March-May globally averaged sea surface temperature was 1.15°F above the 20th century average of 61.0°F – also the fourth highest for March-May in the record. Year-to-Date (January-May 2018). The year-to-date temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.39°F above the 20th century average of 55.5°F – tying with 2010 as the fourth highest for January-May in the 139-year record. The 2018 year-to-date value was 0.59°F lower than the record high set in 2016. The year-to-date globally averaged land surface temperature was 2.18°F above the 20th century average of 42.8°F. This value tied with 2002 as the fifth highest for January-May in the record. The year-to-date globally averaged sea surface temperature was 1.08°F above the 20th century average of 60.8°F. This was also the fifth highest for January-May in the 1880-2018 record. The number of white suspected terrorists being arrested in the UK has overtaken those of Asian appearance for the first time in more than a decade. Statistics released by the Home Office show an overall fall in terror arrests of 22 per cent in the year, with 351 made in the 12 months to the end of June. “The fall is partly due to a relatively large number of arrests being made following terrorist attacks in London and Manchester last year,” a report said. White suspects accounted for 38 per cent of terror-related arrests, followed by those of Asian appearance on 37 per cent and black suspects on 9 per cent. “This was the first time, since the year ending June 2005, that the proportion of white people arrested has exceeded the proportion of Asian people arrested,” the report said. “It was the second highest number of arrests of white people in a year since the data collection began in 2001.” The demographics of terrorists in prison, where Islamists make up the majority, is also changing, as the number of far-right extremists jailed rises.

Read our privacy notice The Home Office said: “The number of Islamist, extremist prisoners saw a slight decrease for the first time. ✕ Isis fighters in Afghanistan are communicating with UK terror cells, defence secretary Gavin Williamson says “The proportion of prisoners holding far-right ideologies has increased steadily over the past three years, with the number up from 10 to 28 in the latest year.” Terror arrests have risen significantly since Isis declared its so-called “state” across Syria and Iraq, causing at least 900 people to leave the UK for its territories and others, who remained in the country, arrested for raising money for the group, spreading its propaganda and planning to commit attacks. Then in 2016, National Action became the first far-right group to ever be declared a terrorist organisation in the UK, with waves of police raids targeting the neo-Nazis. Experts have warned of the threat of “reciprocal radicalisation”, where Islamists and the far-right feed off each other to drive support to their own ideologies. Since the Westminster attack in March 2017, security services have foiled 13 Islamist plots and four from the extreme right-wing, seeing numerous would-be killers jailed. Of the five attacks launched in London and Manchester last year, leaving a total of 36 victims dead, Isis claimed responsibility for four and one was carried out by a far-right extremist targeting Muslims. Islamists make up 82 per cent of terrorist prisoners, followed by 13 per cent far-right and the rest made up of other ideologies including links to Northern Ireland. Police leaders said the past year saw highest number of terrorists tried and successfully convicted, since data collection began in 2009. Life sentences were handed out in 10 cases, including for the men who mounted the Finsbury Park and Parsons Green terror attacks.

The number of active investigations being carried out by specialist police and the security services has reached it’s highest ever level, currently standing at more than 650 probes focusing on the “most dangerous individuals”. “Demands upon CT Policing have increased by about a third since the start of 2017,” said deputy assistant commissioner Haydon. “The step-change in terrorist activity is matched only by an increased effort from police and security services, and our officers are working incredibly hard to protect the public and to bring people to justice, which is evidenced by the impressive conviction rate achieved in the last year. “But I would also like to use this opportunity to remind the public that they, too, play a part in these successes. “Many of these arrests, convictions and investigations hinge upon vital information provided by members of the public.” The figures came as the government consults on new terror laws contained in the Counter Terrorism and Border Security Bill. If enacted, it could spark a dramatic increase in terror arrests, which are currently being made under two Terrorism Acts, by introducing new crimes. They include viewing terrorist propaganda online just once, entering “designated areas” abroad, and making “reckless” statements that could drive support for a banned group.

238ef94f,"Theresa May defends NHS passport checks despite questions over 'health tourism' Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead. Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasn’t utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House. “It’s kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef,” said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. “But Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal he’s eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton.” Mr. Trump’s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President’s eating habits to the press. “It’s borderline creepy,” the staffer said. “The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he’s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.” Mr. Trump’s McDonalds habits are even weirder. “He orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M’s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.” No wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit. The Halfway Post wishes her good luck on her future endeavors. (Photo courtesy of Shelby Bell.)

28ee11a1,"Redrawn Senate map passes House, scramble for seats begin By The Journal Sentinel's Guy Boulton wrote this Jan. 1 in describing Obamacare's health insurance exchanges: The exchanges could help consumers and small businesses compare competing health plans and they also could increase price competition by requiring health insurers to offer more standardized plans and by providing consumers with better information about what they are buying. Private-sector free-market insurance exchanges already exist without government intervention or taxpayer subsidies. If you Google health insurance quote, you will find a number of options. There are dozens of companies and hundreds of plan choices with a wide range of monthly costs depending on plan design. I used one of these to purchase insurance for my family, and millions of other people have used them as well. They work without government involvement. The real reason government-run exchanges are being created is to expand Medicaid and government-subsidized insurance. How will income or family size be verified on a website? This concept is ripe for fraud and abuse. And the subsidies are so generous that families of four making as much as $89,000 will be eligible for taxpayer subsidies. Our nation cannot afford this expensive program. Our country is overspending at a rapid and unsustainable rate of $1.3 trillion more than tax revenue annually. The federal debt is $15 trillion (and growing) and now is more than the annual Gross Domestic Product. When we are broke and overspending, it doesn't make sense to subsidize 75% of the people of Mississippi or more than half of those with private insurance in Wisconsin. Those pressing for a state or federal health insurance exchange in Wisconsin have misled people by telling them it will produce cost savings for both consumers and taxpayers. A government exchange will increase costs substantially both for consumers and taxpayers. Those saying otherwise may have their own interests at heart but certainly not those of Wisconsin and its citizens. A million-dollar study commissioned by the administration of former Gov. Jim Doyle told us that after Obamacare, nearly 90% of people with insurance will have their costs go up by more than 30%. Because of Obamacare, about 100,000 Wisconsinites will lose the private insurance they have now and will be forced to purchase new insurance. Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court may overturn Obamacare, and the elections in November may result in repeal or reform of the law. Government exchanges don't have to be active until January 2014. There is plenty of time for the state to act after the Supreme Court and the voters have weighed in. Many other states are waiting for the outcome of the Supreme Court and elections. True free-market exchanges do exist, and the competition they generate yields positive results. A government-run Obamacare exchange is deceptive, ill-conceived and an expensive government expansion that our nation cannot afford at this time or in the near future. Remember, the vast majority of citizens have the best health care in the world. Truly poor people already have Medicaid (free taxpayer-paid health care), and older folks have Medicare. The provisions of Obamacare will only increase both insurance and taxpayer costs. Wisconsin should not participate in this costly federal program until the last possible moment. State Sen. Frank Lasee (R-De Pere) represents the 1st Senate District.",fake
74adcdf1,"David Cameron still wants to push for airstrikes against ISIS in Syria David Cameron today insisted that a 'few extra bombs and missiles' will not transform the situation in Syria, but pushed for Britain to join airstrikes against ISIS. The Prime Minister said it makes no sense that the RAF must respect an international border no longer recognised by jihadi fanatics plotting attacks on the UK. France, which last night launched a series of 'massive' air strikes on ISIS in Syria, has said it would be 'appreciated' if Britain joined the fight. But Mr Cameron warned he has yet to persuade enough MPs to ensure a vote on military action was not defeated by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who today said it could bring 'more mayhem and more loss'. RAF Tornados are carrying out bombing raids against ISIS in Iraq but David Cameron has yet to build support in Parliament for military action in neighbouring Syria Speaking at a press conference at the G20 summit in Turkey, David Cameron today insisted that a 'few extra bombs and missiles' will not transform the situation in Syria In the wake of the deadly gun and bomb attacks in Paris, 10 French jets dropped 20 bombs on the ISIS capital of Raqqa, destroying a key command centre, training camp and munitions dump and throwing the city into panic. The bombardment came just two days after President Francois Hollande said the co-ordinated attacks in Paris that killed up to 129 people was an 'act of war' and vowed to strike ISIS in Syria 'without mercy'. The jets launched from sites in Jordan and the Persian Gulf, in coordination with U.S. forces. France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said his country was justified in taking action in Syria. 'It was normal to take the initiative and action and France had the legitimacy to do so. We did it already in the past, we have conducted new airstrikes in Raqqa today, Fabius said. 'One cannot be attacked harshly, and you know the drama that is happening in Paris, without being present and active.' However, Britain is not taking part in the action in Syria because MPs have so far refused to authorise the extension of airstrikes in neighbouring Iraq. Mr Cameron was humiliated in 2013 when Tory rebels joined with Labour to vote down a plan to launch missile strikes against the Assad regime. There is a very strong case for saying Isil doesn't stop at the Iraq/Syria border and therefore neither should we Prime Minister David Cameron It forced the PM into an embarrassing retreat and damaged relations with US President Barack Obama who had to go it alone in sending jets into Syrian airspace. However, public outrage at the Paris attacks and the wider refugee crisis fuelled by the rise of ISIS has put the issue back on the table. Speaking at a press conference at the G20 summit in Turkey, Mr Cameron said: 'There is a very strong case for saying Isil doesn't stop at the Iraq/Syria border and therefore neither should we, but I recognise that I need to do more to build this argument, build this case, to take Parliament with me. 'I think people want to know that there is a whole plan for the future of Syria, the future of the region, because it is perfectly right to say that a few extra bombs and missiles won't transform the situation. 'As the secretary-general of the United Nations put it a few years ago: 'A missile can kill a terrorist, but it is good government and good governance that can kill terrorism'. That is what we need.' David Cameron, who today met Russian President Vladimir Putin to push for a political solution to the crisis in Syria, warned it makes no sense not to extend the strikes across a border which ISIS itself does not recognise Mr Cameron has repeatedly made clear he believes it makes no sense not to extend the strikes across a border which ISIS itself does not recognise. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I support the action in Syria. We are part of the enablers for that. It is happening anyway. The question is should we go further in joining that action. 'I've always said I think it is sensible that we should. ISIL does not recognise a border between Iraq and Syria and neither should we. 'But I need to build the argument. I need to take it to Parliament. I need to convince more people.' He insisted that British 'military hard power' was already having an effect in Iraq, where ISIS has 'lost about 25 to 30 per cent of the territory that they held'. UK military forces including drones had also been used to help find, target and kill leading ISIS fighters posing a direct threat to Britain, including former Cardiff schoolboy Reyaad Khan, killed by a British drone in Syria in August. British intelligence planes were also involved in the mission to trace ISIS murderer Jihadi John, who was killed by an American drone strike on Thursday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warned that increased military action was not the solution to the crisis, and ruled out giving his MPs a free vote on military intervention LABOUR WILL NOT GET A FREE VOTE ON BOMBING ISIS IN SYRIA Jeremy Corbyn faces a challenge from his own MPs over military action in Syria after he ruled out allowing a free vote on bombing the ISIS stronghold. The Labour leader told Sky News: I’m hoping we will be able to come to that position in agreement, actually with a number of other Conservatives, so that is indeed the position I’m putting forward. I don’t think a free vote is something that we’re offering. It puts him on collision course with dozens of Labour MPs who privately think Britain should step up its involvement. Chris Leslie, former shadow chancellor, said: 'We shouldn't pre-empt any proposal about how to tackle the ISIS threat or rule anything out at this stage, surely?' Advertisement But Mr Cameron insisted he would not force a vote in the Commons on action in Syria unless he was sure he could win. 'We won't hold that vote unless we can see that Parliament would endorse that action because to fail on this would be damaging - it's not a question of damaging the government, its a question of not damaging our country and its reputation in the world. 'So I will build the case but in the end Parliament must decide. 'I have made the promise to Parliament as previous prime ministers have done that we won't commit to military action in a premeditate way without having a vote. 'Of course I think the British military would bring greater effect to what's happening in Syria. 'What we should be doing as well as building the argument doesn't stop at the Iraq-Syria border is we should be pushing for this political settlement which in the end is going to be the way that gives us a government in Syria that can represent all of the Syrian people and be our ally in wiping out the scourge of Islamist terror that is leading to the loss of life in our own countries and the Middle East.' However the Tory government the faces opposition from both Labour and dozens of Conservative MPs. Labour leader Mr Corbyn warned that increased military action was not the solution to the crisis. He told ITV's Lorraine: 'Does the bombing change it? Probably not. The idea has to be, surely, a political settlement in Syria, very difficult to achieve. 'There are some signs that the talks over the weekend have made some progress - Iran, Russia, USA, European Union, around a table together with all the regional governments, particularly Turkey is key. 'But also, who's funding ISIS, who is arming ISIS, who's providing safe havens for ISIS to get there. 'You have to ask questions about the arms that everyone has sold in the region, the role of Saudi Arabia in this, I think there are some very big questions and we have to be careful. One war doesn't necessarily bring about peace, it often can bring yet more conflict and more mayhem and more loss.' France's ambassador to the UK Sylvie Bermann has said it would be 'appreciated' if the RAF carried out raids in Syria alongside the French. She told Murnaghan: 'It is difficult to comment because it is not only a Government decision but they have decided to consult with the Parliament. If they do participate like us, of course we will appreciate it because we have always fought side by side but it is their decision.' She added: 'We have to fight side by side if we want to defeat terrorism. ' Former prime minister Tony Blair called for Britain to join airstrikes in Syria last week, before the Paris attacks: 'It's no great secret; I think it is essential for Britain to play its part in the fight against this hideous extremism that is brutalising the lives of so many people.' One of the ten French fighter jets prepares to take off from an airbase in the United Arab Emirates French fighter jets launch a wave of 'massive' air strikes on ISIS in Syria as the country started its 'pitiless' retribution for the Paris attacks SEVEN ATTACKS FOILED IN THE LAST YEAR AS 1,900 SPIES HIRED Britain is to recruit an extra 1,900 spies to counter the threat posed by ISIS terror cells in Syria. David Cameron today revealed seven deadly plots to cause havoc in the UK have been disrupted in the last 12 months. But he warned that the scale and severity of the attacks in Paris which left 129 people dead were far greater than anything seen by intelligence agencies to date. The security and intelligence services will receive a major increase in funding in response to the ISIS threat, which has been blamed for the bombing of a Russian airliner in Egypt and the Paris attack in recent weeks. Mr Cameron announced a 15 per cent increase in the 12,700-strong staff of the security and intelligence agencies MI5, MI6 and GCHQ with the recruitment of an additional 1,900 personnel. Meanwhile spending on aviation security will increase to at least double the current £9million a year. The Prime Minister said the UK was engaged in a 'generational struggle' against extremist terror. The additional spending will help 'combat those who would destroy us and our values' and allow Britons to 'continue with our way of life we hold so dear'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I have been aware of these cells operating in Syria that are radicalising people in our own country, potentially sending people back to carry out attacks. 'Our security services have stopped seven attacks in the last six months, albeit on a smaller scale.' Downing Street later clarified that the figure was for the last year. Plans for how to respond to a Paris-style marauding gun attack have been reviewed in the wake of the Paris atrocity, which marked a change in the nature of ISIS plots. 'It could've happened here,' Mr Cameron said. 'We stand in total solidarity with France after the appalling attacks in Paris. Advertisement Tory MP Crispin Blunt, the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, said an RAF bombing campaign in Syria would be an 'ineffective move' because 'it wouldn't be part of a coherent international plan to achieve our mission which is the defeat of Isis'. Mr Blunt told Sky News: 'Whether or not eight British aeroplanes should fly slightly wider air operations is not going to change anything militarily, the French are already flying there, the Americans are already flying the vast number of the missions there alongside now the Russians as well. 'Making that picture slightly more complex is not actually going to change the outcome and what we've got to do here is to focus on the outcome. What's the mission? The mission is to defeat Isis, we're not going to defeat the ideology immediately, that's going to take a much longer time but it's much easier to make sure that we can't have attacks projected on us such as the ones we've had in Paris if Isis does not control territory and there is nowhere for people to go, of whatever type, to go and fight for them. 'That territory has got to be taken off them, we've got to have an agreement about how to do that.' Labour under Mr Corbyn has vowed to oppose any extension of British involvement, calling for a 'peaceful' solution to the conflict. However the hardline stance risks putting him increasingly at odds with voters appalled at the Paris attacks. Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn told Sky News that it was not possible 'to defeat Isil in Syria just by dropping bombs'. Shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott said Labour will only consent to extending military action into Syria if there is a UN mandate to do so. Speaking in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, the shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott, outlined the circumstances which will be required for her party to back a bid to extend the UK's military role from Iraq and into Syria. She told Murnaghan on Sky News: 'As far as Labour's policy in relation to Syria, we actually discussed this at party conference and we have a policy. 'We can only agree to bomb in Syria first of all if there is a UN resolution and also, and this is my particular concern, if there is a plan to deal with the refugees that will result from further military action.' When asked if the Paris attacks had changed any of that, Ms Abbott said: 'Yes, it is a game changer in that it makes the need to resolve the civil war in Syria even more urgent than it was and that's part of Labour party's policy, that we put the need for a diplomatic solution to the Syrian civil war right at the top of the agenda.'",partial

Then, Casten turns around and tells a group of voters, “Because we are still a nation where the majority of people voted for Hillary Clinton, we are still a nation where the majority are good people.” Hillary Clinton’s career is easily one of the most well-documented cases of political corruption in American History. “Now, I understand Sean Casten may feel a little sheepish commenting on another Democrat’s tax fraud, since it was recently revealed that Casten himself was committing tax fraud,” said Jeanne Ives. “Ignoring corruption and refusing to use your platform to expose wrong-doing might keep you in favor with party bosses, but it also makes you complicit in your party’s culture of abuse.

b4b6057f,"Wages back above pre-economic crisis levels SHARE Madison - Gov. Scott Walker's proposal to increase funding for voucher and public charter schools as well as his plan to create a new stream of funding to allow special-needs children to attend private schools drew immediate criticism Sunday from the state's largest teacher union, public school advocates and a major disability rights group. According to funding proposals unveiled by the governor's office Sunday, Walker is making money available that could be used as incentive payments for teachers and schools based on how well schools perform on state report cards. Walker will propose a modest increase - roughly 1% - in funding for Wisconsin public schools in his budget to the Legislature on Wednesday, two years after his steep cuts and all but elimination of collective bargaining for teachers sparked the unsuccessful movement to recall Walker from office. Tom Beebe, project director for Opportunity to Learn Wisconsin, a liberal-leaning group and former executive director of the Wisconsin Alliance for Excellent Schools, has been critical of Walker's cuts to education. He said the amount of general aid increase proposed for this next biennial budget - $129.2 million over two years - only amounts to about $161 for each of Wisconsin's 800,000 public-school students. If the revenue cap does not go up, then there is no new money going to schools no matter how much aid increases, Beebe said. The increase in school funding simply goes to property-tax payers, not into the classroom. Mary Bell, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the state's largest teacher union, said the modest increase was really just keeping overall revenue for schools flat. The stagnant revenue on top of the largest cuts to education funding in Wisconsin history in the last budget is another clear indication that this governor has no intention of supporting neighborhood schools, Bell said in a statement. (Walker's) real focus is privatizing public education with another infusion of resources to the unaccountable taxpayer-funded private school voucher program while leaving our neighborhood public schools on life support, she added. The Republican-controlled Legislature will review Walker's budget over the next four months and make changes before voting on it sometime in June. The two-year spending plan takes effect in July. State Rep. Sondy Pope, ranking Democrat on the Assembly's Education Committee, said Walker's proposal isn't enough. At the rate of state aid funding for public schools, it would take 12 years to replace the money lost in the last budget, she said. Walker contends schools have been able to save money because the collective bargaining law also required teachers to contribute more toward their pension and health care benefits. The nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance reported in November that those cuts in benefits and limiting union-negotiated raises to the rate of inflation offset about two-thirds of the reductions in school revenue in the 2011-'12 academic year. Pope said the increase in aid Walker is proposing won't be enough to help schools struggling to make ends meet. These people are trying to starve Wisconsin public schools, she said. Republican Sen. Luther Olsen, chairman of the Senate's Education Committee, said he was glad to see Walker putting more money into public education. It's a lot better than having to cut like we did in the last budget, he said. It's not as much as I wanted, but we're glad it's not negative or zero. Walker's funding for schools includes $73 million more for voucher schools, $23 million for charter schools, and $21 million in grants for special-needs students to receive a voucher to attend private schools. A proposal for those special-needs vouchers passed the Assembly last session, despite broad opposition from the state Department of Public Instruction, disabilities rights groups, and the state school boards association. It did not pass the Senate. Lisa Pugh, public policy coordinator for Disability Rights Wisconsin, expressed concern that special-needs vouchers were now being proposed as part of the budget, because it would be a significant policy change in the way students with special needs are served. And that should be debated in education legislative committees, she said. Also, the $21 million for special-needs children could have been applied to help public schools across the state, not just for the minority of children who could use that taxpayer subsidy to attend a private school, she said. Walker's plans for expanding the more well-known voucher system encompassing Milwaukee's long-standing program and Racine's new program are highly anticipated, but he did not immediately provide those details. Funding for the UW System would go up $181 million under the budget, two years after it was cut by $315 million. Technical college aid would increase $5 million. UW spokesman David Giroux said the increased funding, coupled with the university being exempted from so-called lapses that could have resulted in $66 million in cuts, was very positive. We want to create a stronger workforce for Wisconsin, and new taxpayer investments are essential to that effort, Giroux said. It looks like we will have enough funding to preserve today's levels of college access and quality, along with new investments in UW programs focused on job creation. That's a smart investment. Walker is making $64 million available in incentive payments for K-12 schools, tied to their grades on statewide report cards. Of that, $24 million would go to schools with an A or B grade, $30 million would go to schools that show a certain level of improvement on the report cards and $10 million would be available to the lowest-performing districts for a one-time grant if they provide an acceptable improvement plan. Brian Pleva, lobbyist for the American Federation for Children Wisconsin, a conservative group, praised Walker's increase for voucher- and charter-school funding because it would give low-income and middle-class parents more educational choices. He also said that special-needs scholarships would help a minority of families for which local public schools aren't meeting their children's needs. Walker said in a statement Sunday that the budget proposals will reward successes and provide incentives to schools to drive achievement and accountability. In this next biennial budget, total K-12 funding would go up $276 million, according to the AP. But Walker will not lift the lid on revenue limits, saying he was concerned about moves that might cause property taxes to increase. The proposed increase in aid to schools comes after Walker cut general school aid by $834 million two years ago, a more than 8% drop from the previous funding period. To restrict school boards from raising property taxes to replace the drop in school aid, the governor proposed reducing districts' revenue limit authority - the combined amount they're able to raise in local property taxes and state general school aid - by 5.5%. As a result, the average school per-pupil revenue limit dropped about $555 in 2011-'12, from $10,100 in 2010-'11.

25aa97f1,"Kremlin: German Clinic's Diagnosis of Navalny's Condition Doesn't Show He Was Definitely Poisoned Many Democrats are crowing that the 82nd Legislature will go down as one in which, despite the emergency push for sanctuary cities legislation, nothing emerged from the Capitol that waill substantially alter the way immigration laws are enforced. Yet Republicans did manage to eke out one small victory during the special session, successfully attaching language to Senate Bill 1, the must-pass fiscal matters bill, that would require people applying for driver's licenses or other state-issued identification cards to prove they're in the country legally. Such a policy, as opposed to a law on the books, had been in effect since 2008, when the Texas Department of Public Safety began requiring applicants for driver’s licenses and ID cards to produce government-issued documents that affirmed their legal status. Before 2008, according to DPS spokeswoman Tela Mange, such proof was not required to obtain a license or ID. Immigrants' rights groups were irate over the policy change, which they alleged could have the effect of denying legal residents access to those forms of ID, with DPS clerks acting as de facto immigration agents. In 2009, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund sued DPS, arguing that the agency overstepped its authority by implementing the policy even though the Legislature rejected similar legislation in the 2007 session. Last month, however, House Appropriations Chairman Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, took matters into his own hands. Pitts cribbed language requiring applicants for driver's licenses and ID cards to prove their legal residency from Senate Bill 9, an omnibus homeland security bill filed by state Sen. Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands, and added it as an amendment to SB 1. The amendment also allows the DPS to determine expiration dates for those IDs based on when an immigration document was issued. For a non-citizen or non-permanent legal resident, DPS can issue a document that “expires on the earlier of a date specified by DPS or the expiration date of the applicant's authorized stay in the United States.” If the immigration document does not have an expiration date, DPS can issue an ID or license that expires every year. During the just-concluded regular and special sessions, Williams argued that Texas was only one of three states that didn’t have a policy regarding legal status for ID applicants and said one was necessary to ensure that foreign criminals were not receiving IDs. He noted that, as part of an appropriation of $64 million over the next biennium for temporary visitors stations, DPS staff will be trained to identify and approve the dozens of immigration documents currently used to apply for driver's licenses and IDs. People attempting to renew their exisiting licenses or IDs but don't have immediate access to passports or birth certificates could also be impacted by the new law, Mange said. The Pitts amendment requires that they provide DPS with proof of residency or citizenship as well. Mange said the agency may have something in its files indicating that an applicant has previously produced such proof, but if it was before 2008, she said, you may want to bring something just in case. Mange said that Texans should receive a notice from DPS when it's time to renew that will inform them whether they're eligible to renew online, which can only happen if they didn't renew online the previous time. We require everyone to come in once every 12 years so we can see your smiling face, she said. The Legislature’s actions could signal an end to the 2009 court case. Still, MALDEF attorney Luis Figueroa questions the timing of the Pitts amenemnt, which coincides with the passage of a new Voter ID law requiring citizens to show a valid state-issued ID before casting a ballot. Democrats and advocacy groups, including MALDEF, rallied against the Voter ID measure during the session, claiming it would decrease turnout at a time when Texas already ranks near the bottom of all states in ballot-box participation. During the Voter ID debate, Democrats charged the law would make it difficult, in particular, for senior citizens who haven't had a picture ID in years to vote. “If [voters] are trying at the last minute to get a driver’s license and trying to get the documents they need and they are rejected, it’s going to make the process slower,” Figueroa said. Aides to both Pitts and state Rep. Charlie Geren, R-Fort Worth, who worked with the Senate to attach the amendment to SB 1, said they were unaware of those concerns. They noted a majority of Senate Democrats voted for SB 9 during the regular session, when it contained the driver's license/ID provision. But Geren expressed some displeasure this week that the driver’s license language made it on to the fiscal matters bill while “sanctuary cities” language — which would prohibit local entities from adopting policies that prevent the enforcement of state and federal immigration laws — did not. Failure to pass a sanctuary cities bill, which Gov. Rick Perry declared an emergency item during the regular session and added to the special-session call, resulted a round of finger-pointing by the House and Senate. The House, which approved a bill in the regular session, blamed the Senate for not following suit. The Senate, which passed a bill in the special session, blamed the House for failing even to move it out of committee in the special. Perry then blamed state Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock who chaired the SB 1 conference committee, for refusing to add sanctuary cities to the committee's report. “They were several interviews [in which] some of the senators said that SB9 did not belong in SB1,” an animated Geren said. “Well, they sure as hell wanted this part of SB9 in SB1.”",partial
88a75bcc,"Months after being denied media credentials for the Texas House, the conservative organization Texas Scorecard — a product of Empower Texans, a Tea Party-aligned political advocacy group with one of the state’s best-funded political action committees — has filed a First Amendment lawsuit arguing that its rejection from the lower chamber constitutes “unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.” Before the legislative session kicked off in January, two employees of Texas Scorecard, Brandon Waltens and Destin Sensky, applied for media credentials in both chambers of the Legislature. In the Senate, their credentials were granted; in the House, they were denied. The two chambers follow similar rules about who is allowed special journalistic access to the floor, and both prohibit lobbyists. But the chambers’ political atmospheres are different. House Administration Chair Charlie Geren, a Fort Worth Republican who has sparred with Empower Texans and its PAC in the past, told the group in a January rejection letter that it was ineligible for media credentials because “the organization you are employed by, Texas Scorecard, has a close association with a general-purpose political committee (GPAC) and that the organization’s website prominently displays advocacy on policy matters before the legislature.” As evidence of the group’s affiliation with the PAC, Geren cited the organizations' shared address — but by the time Geren’s letter was issued, the lawsuit claims, they no longer shared that address. Empower Texans PAC has backed primary opponents to Geren and has given Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who leads the Texas Senate, more than $850,000 in the last five years. In the lawsuit, filed this week in federal court in Austin, the organization alleges that its history with Geren — who, the complaint says, “has routinely and openly expressed hostility” to the group “on account of their publications” — led him to engage in “bad faith viewpoint discrimination.” It asks a federal judge to force Geren to issue media credentials to the two employees. Reached on the floor of the Texas House on Wednesday morning, Geren said he had no comment on the lawsuit. Empower Texans, which operates under several names, is a unique blend of political action committee, advocacy group and news outlet. During the session, it produces a biweekly newspaper and a weekday morning newsletter, as well as a weekly podcast and video broadcast. But the organization also directly advocates for specific votes on specific measures — releasing regular “vote notices” that call on elected officials to back its priorities — and ranks lawmakers on an A-F scale as either “pro-” or “anti-taxpayer.” Although they do not have media credentials in the Texas House, Waltens and Sensky — like anyone else — can sit in the public second-floor gallery. Only journalists, lawmakers, staff and special guests are permitted on the chambers’ floors, where they enjoy easier access to elected officials. The lawsuit alleges that “by denying plaintiffs access to the hall of the House equal to that afforded to other media representatives, [Geren] is violating Plaintiffs’ rights to free speech and freedom of the press.” The complaint claims that “no employee of Empower Texans is required to register as a lobbyist and the organization does not employ or contract with any person who is required to register as a lobbyist.” The organization has presented itself as a journalism outlet before. In 2017, Geren pulled a press pass that had been issued for another employee of the group, Cary Cheshire  Waltens and Sensky are common fixtures at the press table in the Texas Senate, where their coverage sometimes reflects the conservative bent of their organization. They have also reported on goings-on in the Texas House. A 30-year old man from Kentucky underwent some radical plastic surgery in order to physically resemble Jesus Christ. According to the Lexington Daily Tribune, Mark Emery has already been following Jesus’ footsteps in many different ways for several years, becoming a carpenter himself, as well as studying ancient Jewish law and religious texts. He went so far as to spend more than $215,000 on two years worth of plastic surgery to change his physical appearance to resemble Jesus. After undergoing a total of 21 surgical interventions, he claims to be “almost satisfied” with the results. “Some people buy fancy cars or fancy mansions… I use my money to show my love for Jesus by getting surgery to look more like him,” says Mr. Emery. “I try to live by his example and to be as much like him as I can. For me, acting like Jesus wasn’t enough, I really wanted to be like him and look like him.” The young man used various images and icons in order to determine the actual appearance of Christ before beginning his various surgeries. Many critics have already arisen in the social media, both denouncing or mocking Mr. Emery’s attempt to resemble Jesus Christ. Hundreds of people, including various religious leaders, have made some religiously oriented critics, denouncing as “blasphemy” or “heresy” his desire to physically imitate the appearance of Christ. “Christians love Jesus and try to act like him, not look like him. Shame on you. That’s ridiculous and anti-Christian” wrote Pastor John Hagee on his Twitter account. Many critics have also described Mr. Emery’s surgery as “ridiculous” since the physical appearance of Jesus Christ remains unclear and is still subject to a lot of debate. A special on PBS special put together a large study to determine what Jesus must have looked like, and this is the result they obtained. The Bible itself gives no physical description of Jesus in the sense of describing his skin tone, hair style, or facial traits. Many theories have been elaborated by scholars over the years, some of them incredibly far-fetched, claiming that Jesus could have been West African, Egyptian or half-Roman among others, but none of these claims were backed on any proof. It is generally accepted among historians, that Jesus was not of European descent, as he is usually depicted on icons and crucifixes. He would instead have resembled a modern-day Arab, Turk or other middle eastern man, having a slightly darker skin color. Despite all these critics, Mr. Emery says that he is really happy with the results of his surgery, claiming that he now feels closer to Jesus than he had ever felt in his life.",fake

8de5ccdd,"The Phony War Against CO2 248 Counties Have More Registered Voters Than Live Adults 24 States Show Corrupted Voter Rolls (INDIANAPOLIS, IN.) – September 25, 2017: The Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) today announced that it placed 248 counties on notice for holding more registered voters than adult residents in their respective jurisdictions. Officials in 24 states now risk lawsuits if they do not disclose satisfactory data demonstrating effective voter roll maintenance efforts before and after the 2016 Election. “During the 2016 Election, 24 states had bloated voter rolls,” PILF President and General Counsel J. Christian Adams said. “Voter fraud begins with corrupted voter rolls. Our nation’s voter rolls have records that cannot be distinguished between living or dead; citizen or alien; resident or relocated. We hear about possible cyber-attacks, but we aren’t doing enough to fix voter rolls that are certainly corrupt. The voter rolls are so bad in some states that election officials would have a hard time telling the difference between sabotage and negligence.” Letters mailed to the counties and locales in question note that it appears they are violating the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) because they are not properly maintaining the voter rolls. The NVRA (also known as Motor Voter) requires state and local election officials to properly maintain voter rolls and ensure that only eligible voters are registered. Holding more registrants than living adults indicates that election officials have failed to properly maintain voter rolls. The Public Interest Legal Foundation has a distinguished record of bringing litigation against counties and locales with bloated voter rolls—yielding settlements and consent decrees that, if followed properly, will put jurisdictions on a path to more realistic voter registration rates. PILF has been involved in bringing nine separate lawsuits in the last two years to enforce list maintenance provisions of the NVRA, including in Texas, Mississippi, Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania. PILF recently completed the first trial in the history of the NVRA to enforce list maintenance obligations. The case was brought on behalf of the American Civil Rights Union against Broward County, Florida. States with counties that received a notice letter are (# of counties): Kentucky (41), Michigan (32), Iowa (31), Illinois (22), Mississippi (19), Colorado (17), Texas (12), Alabama (12), South Dakota (12), Nebraska (9), Georgia (6), New York (6), West Virginia (6), New Mexico (5), North Carolina (5), California (2), Louisiana (2), Montana (2), Virginia (2), Arizona (1), Florida (1), Missouri (1), Oklahoma (1), and Washington State (1). Kentucky’s surpassing Michigan as the most bloated state is particularly concerning giving the Secretary of State’s belligerent, public refusals to share voter data with the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, despite the State’s offering of the same information here. “Federal law requires election officials to conduct a reasonable effort to maintain voter registration lists free of dead voters, ineligible voters, and voters who have moved away,” the notice letters state. “Based on our comparison of publicly available information published by the U.S. Census Bureau and the federal Election Assistance Commission, it appears that your jurisdiction is failing to comply with these federal law requirements.” The notices seek a variety of documents to clearly discern which jurisdictions are failing to perform basic voter list maintenance duties. Some records sought concern: noncitizen voters; numbers of dead, duplicate, relocated, and felon removals; evidence of use for databases which better identify relocated or alien registrants; and third-party communications about voter rolls, among others.

976a9cc4,"Majority of Britons think police have lost control of the streets The row over school closures during the pandemic has exploded into full blown conflict this weekend, with teachers putting Nicola Sturgeon in the firing line, and turning on a hardline parent group which wants kids back in class no matter what. Writer at Large Neil Mackay reports The teachers SCOTLAND’S teachers have had enough. Firstly, teachers say, they’ve had enough of Nicola Sturgeon putting her electoral fortunes ahead of education. Secondly, they’ve had enough of being bullied, harassed and attacked by what they see as a highly politicised mob on social media employing Trump-style tactics against them, and demanding schools stay open even in the most dangerous of circumstances. Larry Flanagan, head of Scotland’s largest teaching union the EIS, deals with the Scottish Government every day as the nation’s schools struggle to make it through lockdown. Ask him about Sturgeon’s handling of Covid and schools and he pointedly says: “I think the First Minister is very focused on the election.” Privately, senior Scottish teachers who work with the Government on the pandemic aren’t so diplomatic. “John Swinney [Deputy First Minister and Education Secretary] has his eye firmly fixed on the educational challenges,” one said. “The First Minister has her eye firmly fixed on the election. There’s a tension in Government there.” Flanagan feels that “Nicola Sturgeon and her Government are as focused on the politics of the situation as they are on the educational issues – whereas our focus is entirely educational”. The SNP administration “has an eye on the political optics as much as anything else”. Sturgeon is sensitive to criticism that she’s putting politics before education. Flanagan says he doesn’t understand why “as it’s in their DNA”. Flanagan also feels that “the general message of the Government has been less than empathetic to teachers”. The experience of teachers has been “harrowing, high stress … Most have been living on the edge and torn between the desire to do their best for students but also knowing they’re at risk on a daily basis … A lot feel undervalued, particularly by Government and the political class.” He adds: “It can be a demoralising experience. We’ve said directly to Government … that it’s shown a distant lack of empathy with the challenges that have existed in schools, as if there are no issues to be concerned about. They’ve underplayed teacher concerns.” On the First Minister, Flanagan says: “If you were to analyse most of her comments she rarely says very much about teachers, her focus is on parents and pupils, and that’s legitimate … for her to be concerned about, but I think a lot of teachers feel she’s just dismissive of their concerns.” Although schools are now closed, many teachers feel they had to battle to get this far against a government which wanted to put the wishes of parents before safety. Although teachers obviously worry for themselves and their families, many also felt that keeping schools open endangered pupils, pupils’ families and the wider community. Teachers haven’t forgotten the period before Christmas when they clamoured for school closures as the new Covid variant started to hit but the Government remained intransigent, insisting schools were safe and should remain open. Teachers were horrified that schools remained opened as level four restrictions were introduced. “That’s when the political debate became sharper,” Flanagan said, adding: “All we wanted was at level four, each council should look at the potential for blended or remote learning if it was required.” He references cases such as one Scottish school which “had over 400 pupils off with Covid-related illnesses and self-isolation ... and they still weren’t closing the school … We were saying there’s clearly a huge community outbreak in this area – closing the school makes sense, going to remote learning is a better educational position and it’ll drive down infection levels, but at that point it had become a kind of totem for the Government that they weren’t going to close schools”. Flanagan told Swinney that he thought the Education Secretary was “frightened to close schools in case you get a backlash”. Nor have teachers forgotten that the Government backtracked on plans for blended learning and suddenly switched, opting for a full reopening of schools last summer. “That was just a straight political decision as the FM was concerned at the backlash … the FM realised that having blended learning for a year was unlikely to do her party’s election chances any good so she wanted a different message.” Referencing the past debate around closing schools, Flanagan highlighted what he calls “the sophistry you get from the Scottish Government. They said ‘the risk to teenagers is no greater than to adults’. Well, that’s fine, but there’s quite a high risk to adults. You’re downplaying it by saying ‘it’s not greater than’ … John Swinney kept saying schools were safe environments. I kept saying they’re not … that’s why teachers were getting annoyed as they downplayed the risk.” Claims over the safety benefits of pupils social distancing incense teachers. “It’s not possible,” says Flanagan. No teacher spoken to said it was possible to keep a class of 30 pupils socially distanced. Teachers have also expressed concerns over Government use of data. Flanagan says that in November, data was used to claim schools were safe but statistics covered just the first six weeks of schools being reopened. “There was political sleight of hand to reference a retrospective report as being immediately applicable to the current situation,” he says. The EIS leader, who sits on the Government’s Covid Education Recovery Group, also raised concerns about the circumstances surrounding schools staying open at the end of last year. “At the time we were calling for a ‘firebreak’ while the Government and local authorities were saying ‘no’, but looking back at the data for the period it shows that school infections had reached their highest peak in all age groups since the pandemic started.” Flanagan added: “I think the Government and the First Minister have got a political objective around schools being open. They’d say that’s because, like us, they understand the importance of schools to young people’s wellbeing. We’re not going to disagree on that but I think they also have quite a political agenda. They’re potentially open to attack from other parties if they’re seen to be closing schools – and getting parental backlash.” In comparison to the UK Government, however, Flanagan is clear that “by and large the Scottish Government’s default position is to seek partnership and collaboration”. The EIS is fully involved in discussions about decision-making. In England, teacher groups “struggle just to get dialogue”. The Scottish Government, he stresses, “is not as unreasonable as the UK Government”. Flanagan is conscious of the fact that he has to keep Government onside. “I need to be able to persuade Government to do the right thing,” he says. Many members, however, are keen to strike if pushed too far. “Ultimately, we’re trying to get a reasonable response from Government … it would be failure of the partnership approach if we had to ballot for industrial action.” Sturgeon said this week that schools will remain shut until at least the middle of February. Teachers, though, fear a rush to reopen before its safe. Flanagan points to the new variant’s “transmissability among young people”. There are fears over reopening schools without properly enforced social distancing among pupils. “All that will happen is the R figure will go up,” Flanagan says. In terms of discussions around the future of reopening schools, he adds: “There’s a lot of unknowns and they’re all contingent on the control of the virus and the impact of the vaccine.” The vast majority of teachers want schools open but they want them reopened safely. “Teachers absolutely know that schools being open is the best thing possible for kids, it’s the easiest option for teachers when it comes to learning as remote learning is a huge challenge.” There is a worry among rank-and-file teachers that Government decisions are taken by civil servants and other experts who know little about life inside schools and so lack “empathy”. Flanagan says that when it comes to Covid, there have been “more fights with individual councils than we’ve had with Government”. There are sometimes different approaches taken to schools across different council areas. “Teachers who were shielding before we moved to lockdown, in a number of areas they were allowed to work from home,” Flanagan says. “In Glasgow, they said ‘no, you can’t, teachers are frontline, they have to be in school or off sick’. This was even for people with medical letters. Glasgow said ‘no’ – so Glasgow can be very hardline.” Teachers also worry that their safety comes secondary to the economy and allowing parents to work. “There’s an element around why schools need to open which isn’t about the needs of children, but the needs of the economy,” says Flanagan, though he adds: “I don’t think it’s writ as large in Scotland as it is in England … by and large Scotland has benefited from a more cautious approach to the virus.” Although teachers are sympathetic to parents, there is a limit to sympathy. “Some of the emails I’m getting … about having to support their child with home learning – I do have to temper my replies … They’re your children – the idea that the school should be there to provide childcare is an unwelcome thread.” Flanagan also feels that “the discourse around lost learning has to be challenged. What we have is interrupted learning, nothing is lost or irretrievable. There are kids every year who miss a whole year because they’re ill and you wouldn’t say about those kids ‘that’s it, you’ve missed your chance’. It’s nihilistic. To say your future is gone is just rubbish. Politicians fall into this trap far too easily.” Teachers are critical of Government failure to prepare for this new lockdown when it comes to remote learning and “digital inequality” – the lack of computers, and wi-fi, for poor children. The EIS says not enough equipment has been distributed. “In Glasgow, some iPads issued have protocols which don’t allow kids to access videos.” Flanagan urged the Government to follow a cautious approach to reopening schools. “The key issue now is, with potentially only a few months to go until the vaccine impacts, why would you run a high-risk strategy?” The parents Speak to most teachers, and they’ll tell you that they believe a new online group is twisting the national conversation around schools during Covid. Us For Them – which styles itself as a “grass-roots” parent lobby group – has too much influence in the thinking of the Scottish Government, teachers feel. UFT exists primarily on Facebook and sprang to life during lockdown. Flanagan calls them “the parents from nowhere” – although some figures such as Lord Jack McConnell, former Labour First Minister, has offered them support online. Certainly, UFT doesn’t take the constructive approach to parent-teacher relations of established groups like the National Parent Forum of Scotland. Teachers have accused UFT of undisclosed political connections. There have been claims of an anti-SNP agenda. Flanagan accused the organisation of having a “strong core of Covid deniers”. The EIS and UFT have been engaged in a war of words over claims that teachers were being recorded. Many teachers, Flanagan says, “feel they’re in state of siege”. He claims UFT is a “platform for self-promotion … some of them have political ambitions”. Flanagan says he doesn’t in any way “dismiss the concerns of parents around blended and remote learning” but UFT has “an anti-teacher agenda”. He worries that the organisation is “manipulating the concerns of parents”, and that “their language and attitude [is] intimidating”. Teachers are “concerned that Government pays too much attention” to the group, Flanagan says. He speculated that Sturgeon was not “immune” to the organisation “as she reacted to them very quickly last lockdown”. Jo Bisset is the face of UFT in Scotland. She won’t offer any solutions to help make schools safer. “Schools are safe,” Bisset claims, adding: “We don’t see ourselves as having to solve a problem as it’s not a problem we acknowledge.” “We don’t see there’s any need for social distancing in schools … it isn’t a dangerous environment,” she says. Bisset claims that “face masks in schools are really inappropriate”, and references children with autism, hearing impairment and “selective mutism”. She claims “there’s a huge amount of harm from this enforcement of masks” and “having a mask on children in schools doesn’t make any sense”. Nor does Bisset support teachers wearing masks. “If there are vulnerable teachers in schools and they feel they need to wear masks I think my first question would be ‘should that teacher really be in school if they’re so vulnerable’? … Perhaps, they should be furloughed.” Bisset insists that UFT isn’t anti-teacher. “We’re incredibly in favour of teachers,” she claims. Teachers, though, recount incidents of being abused on social media by people connected to UFT. Bisset says this could be people who’ve had “a bad day … and just spill their guts – people often don’t think that closely about what they’re writing on social media and quite frankly why should they?” On the group’s campaign against Government closure of schools, she says: “We’re not going to stop. There may or may not be an election coming up and we think that education is the issue of the election … if political parties aren’t listening to parents now, then they really need to, otherwise they’re going to lose votes.” Bisset says claims that “we’re funded by dark money and we’re all failed Tory candidates and we’ve some big political agenda is completely wrong”. She insists all funding is from the public through sites like GoFundMe. On political connections, she says: “Well, there’s this one guy, but he’s secret, he’s not actually an active politician now but he has been.” She later adds: “He was a Labour MP.” UFT praises MSPs like Alex Neil of the SNP, who has criticised blended learning as “absolutely unacceptable”, and Michelle Ballantyne, tje former Conservative now leading Nigel Farage’s Reform Party in Scotland. Ballantyne was accused a few days ago of “an anti-lockdown rant”. Bisset accused the EIS of “concerted smear attempts”. When asked if UFT could have handled debate better, she replied: “I don’t care. I’m not in politics … I’m not responsible for what nameless people write on the internet.” Teachers say that as UFT frontwoman she must take responsibility. Bisset claimed she’d “love” to work in a classroom unmasked, and doesn’t believe teachers need to socially distance from children. Asked whether this posed a wider infection risk, she claimed: “Coronavirus is principally transmitted adult to adult, so as long as adults are socially distancing then you’re massively reducing your risk – so you can socially distance adults … in schools far more easily than you can do in many other sectors. So for me, if I was a teacher in a school, my key goal would be to socially distance from adults.” Several teachers were asked to comment on this. All dismissed it as “dangerous” or “nonsense”. Bisset, who is from Edinburgh and works in the oil and gas sector, has two teenage children in a private school. When asked if it was unfair of her to comment on state education, she replied: “I don’t know why I’d have to have my children in state school in order to be able to point out a fact that children in the state sector will be getting worse … education typically.” She said “private schools will be delivering a much more comprehensive level of education”. The Government's response Responding to EIS comments, a government spokeswoman said: “Our top priority is the health and safety of pupils, staff and teachers. The current lockdown demonstrates that commitment to keeping people safe. While decisions to move to remote learning are hard, they have been taken in a timely manner in light of the developing public heath position. While we acknowledge the long-standing campaign by Mr Flanagan to have schools closed, we believe that shift came at the right time. “Overall, we believe that the support in place for pupils learning remotely has been well-received. This includes, by the end of December, almost 59,000 devices such as laptops and over 10,000 connectivity packages distributed to learners. In total, the programme, supported by a £25 million investment, is expected to deliver over 70,000 devices for disadvantaged children and young people. A new package of £45 million, announced last week, means councils can supply additional devices or family support to those who need it most. That is substantial and is making a significant difference to the learning that pupils are receiving.”",partial

650bd80f,"Roads to the Capitol: Six new members of Congress on their personal journeys When charges of “racism” and “xenophobia” fail, Democrats’ fallback argument against President Trump’s proposed border wall is that it simply “won’t work,” so why waste billions building it? Tell that to the residents of El Paso, Texas. Federal data show a far-less imposing wall than the one Trump envisions — a two-story corrugated metal fence first erected under the Bush administration — already has dramatically curtailed both illegal border crossings and crime in Texas’ sixth-largest city, which borders the high-crime Mexican city of Juarez. In fact, the number of deportable illegal immigrants located by the US Border Patrol plummeted by more than 89 percent over the five-year period during which the controversial new fence was built, according to Homeland Security data I reviewed. When the project first started in 2006, illegal crossings totaled 122,261, but by 2010, when the 131-mile fence was completed from one end of El Paso out into the New Mexico desert, immigrant crossings shrank to just 12,251. They hit a low of 9,678 in 2012, before slowly ticking back up to a total of 25,193 last year. But they’re still well below pre-fence levels, and the Border Patrol credits the fortified barrier dividing El Paso from Mexico for the reduction in illegal flows. And crime abated with the reduced human traffic from Juarez, considered one of the most dangerous places in the world due to drug-cartel violence, helping El Paso become one of the safest large cities in America. Before 2010, federal data show the border city was mired in violent crime and drug smuggling, thanks in large part to illicit activities spilling over from the Mexican side. Once the fence went up, however, things changed almost overnight. El Paso since then has consistently topped rankings for cities of 500,000 residents or more with low crime rates, based on FBI-collected statistics. The turnaround even caught the attention of former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and other Obama administration officials, who touted it as one of the nation’s safest cities while citing the beefed-up border security there. Federal data illustrates just how remarkable the turnaround in crime has been since the fence was built. According to FBI tables, property crimes in El Paso have plunged more than 37 percent to 12,357 from their pre-fence peak of 19,702 a year, while violent crimes have dropped more than 6 percent to 2,682 from a peak of 2,861 a year. The overall crime rate in El Paso continued to fall last year, prompting city leaders to trumpet the good news in a press release that noted, “Because El Paso is a border town, its low crime rate may surprise you.” Since the fence was completed, the volume of marijuana and cocaine coming through El Paso and seized by Border Patrol agents has been cut in half El Paso City Manager Tommy Gonzalez boasted that the city will “continue to lead our country in public safety.” Another core promise made by Trump to justify constructing a massive wall spanning from Texas to California is that it will slow the flow of drugs coming across the border from Mexico. “We need the wall for security. We need the wall for safety,” Trump said last week while answering questions about the sweeping new GOP immigration bill. “We need the wall for stopping the drugs from pouring in.” On that score, El Paso already has exceeded expectations. Drug smuggling along that border entry point has also fallen dramatically. In fact, since the fence was completed, the volume of marijuana and cocaine coming through El Paso and seized by Border Patrol agents has been cut in half. The year before the wall was fully built in 2010, the volume of illegal drugs confiscated by the feds along the El Paso border hit 87,725 pounds. The year after, the amount of drug seizures plummeted to 43,783 pounds. Last year, they dropped even further to a total of 34,329, according to Border Patrol reports obtained by The Post. All told, a legion of empirical evidence supports the idea a southern border wall could, in fact, work. There is also anecdotal evidence. In local press accounts, El Paso residents and business owners alike have praised the fence, citing it as an effective deterrent to both illegal crossings and crime. see also Border Patrol busts drop to 46-year low Arrests by Border Patrol agents dropped to a 46-year low... Now Trump plans to build a possibly bigger deterrent. The existing fence along the El Paso sector, which is made of a combination of corrugated steel and metal meshing, towers 21-feet high at some points and is already hard to climb. But the Trump wall, which will begin construction in El Paso, will be even taller and have multiple layers of security. Still, Democratic leaders are adamantly opposed to it. They argue the $18 billion wall won’t work to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and will only be a massive waste of tax dollars. “We think, frankly, the building of the wall, its cost is not justified either by its efficiency or effectiveness,” House Minority Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Thursday. Even local Democrats are arguing with success. “That wall in itself is a racist reaction to a racist myth that does not reflect the reality of this country at all,” said Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-El Paso). Paul Sperry is a former Hoover Institution media fellow and author of several books, including the bestseller “Infiltration.”",partial
42b5592a,"Why are climate-change models so flawed? Because climate science is so incomplete Proctor, VT — According to NBC News, a pastor at the Christian Proctor Church in Vermont, has been sentenced to one year in federal prison after refusing to marry gay couples. This comes shortly after the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decisionruling that states must allow gay marriage. The Christian Pastor, 56-year-old Paul Horner, had his lawyer speak to reporters on his behalf. “We are currently disputing the guilty verdict and I am confident my client will be a free man here shortly,” said attorney Tom Downey. “Horner was just using his best judgement according to his rights and religious freedom in this country.” The Honorable Myron Danus handed down the harsh sentence. “Religious freedom goes both ways, Mr. Horner,” Danus told a packed courtroom. “It is not your place to deny individuals the same rights that everyone else has, rights that were passed down and agreed upon in a court of law, the ultimate court, the Supreme Court. It is not your decision whether or not you agree with the law but more importantly that you follow it and enforce it.” According to the criminal investigation, the Christian Proctor Church is registered with the state as a “religious corporation” limited to performing “one-man-one-woman marriages as defined by the Holy Bible.” But the church is also registered as a for-profit business and city officials said that means the owners must comply with state and federal regulations. Steve Shand president of the Vermont Family Research Committee, said it is “open season on Americans who refuse to bow to the government’s redefinition of marriage.” “Homosexuals are gay,” Shand told reporters. “Why should Christian ministers be forced to perform and celebrate any marriage that conflicts with their beliefs? It’s a slippery slope my friend. Pretty soon these same pastors will be forced to wed animals or kitchen appliances. This is not my America!” Gwen Hawkins who is president of the LGBT Pride Center in Vermont said she is happy with the guilty verdict. “We just want the same rights as everyone else and this guilty verdict sets a great precedent,” Hawkins said. “These fanatical Christians base their life on one verse in the Bible but they seem to forget the other 99% of the verses in the book. For example, why can’t we stone to death Bristol Palin for having a baby out of wedlock? And what about her mother, Sarah Palin, breaking the rules of Corinthians 14:34 which clearly state that as a woman, she is not allowed to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. But no, they like to pick the one verse in the Bible about gay people and build their camp around it.” Proctor is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States.

83c0b379,"Nasa scientist says temperatures in the upper atmosphere are set to plunge A Nasa scientist has said a current slowdown in sunspot activity could cause temperatures in the upper layer of our atmosphere to plummet. Other researchers have previously warned that the lack of sunspots could herald the arrival of a uniquely grim ‘mini Ice Age’. But the Nasa scientist went on to say that the trend he sees is overall global warming, not cooling, and insisted this ‘solar minimum’ does not mean the world is going to shiver through a depressingly long winter. ‘We see a cooling trend,’ Martin Mlynczak of Nasa’s Langley Research Center told Space Weather. ‘High above Earth’s surface, near the edge of space, our atmosphere is losing heat energy. ‘If current trends continue, it could soon set a Space Age record for cold.’ Advertisement Advertisement ‘It could happen in a matter of months,’ Mlynczak added. Sunspot activity follows a cycle which is believed to last 11 years as the number of patches peaks and drops. There have been very few spots on the sun for most of this year. An image taken earlier this year showing the surface of our star without sunspots (Picture: Nasa) MORE : Hackers will ‘take down the internet in 2019’ Earlier this year, Nasa released a picture showing the blank face of the sun looking more like a snooker ball than the roiling surface of a super-hot star. The sun is predicted to reach its solar minimum in 2019 or 2020, according to Nasa’s calculations. Perhaps the most famous period of low sunspot activity was the Maunder Minimum of the 17th century. During that time, there was a ‘little ice age’ when the Thames froze over, although researchers believe that global warming will stop this happening again. Solar minimum may enhance the effects of space weather, disrupt communications and navigation, and even cause space junk to ‘hang around’, Nasa said. MORE : An asteroid will ‘inevitably’ hit Earth and have a ‘calamitous’ effect on humanity, scientist warns Last year, a scientist claimed the chilling effect on the lack of sunspots could actually save us from global warming – although her claims were hotly disputed. Valentina Zharkova, a professor of mathematics at Northumbria University, published a paper which contains ‘the first serious prediction of a reduction of solar activity that might affect human lives’. ‘I hope global warming will be overridden by this effect, giving humankind and the Earth 30 years to sort out our pollution,’ she said.

NASA and other climate researchers continue to see a warming trend in the troposphere, the layer of atmosphere closest to Earth’s surface. ‘There is no inconsistency between the science findings of a warming troposphere [where we live] and the Thermosphere Climate Index.’ Update: This article has been amended since initial publication to remove the erroneous suggestion that the possibly record-breaking cooling of the thermosphere, located over 100km above the surface of the Earth, would have the effect on the troposphere of ‘a mini Ice Age’.

St. Mark's Square is virtually deserted after a decree orders for the whole of Italy to be on lockdown in an unprecedented clampdown aimed at beating the coronavirus, in Venice, Italy, March 10, 2020. REUTERS/Manuel Silvestri You can walk into a church but you can’t cross yourself with holy water because the font is dry. You can’t get baptized or married in a church and you can’t even have a funeral. Just about the only thing a person can do in a church in Italy is pray - but at least a pew away from someone else. Overwhelmingly Catholic Italy is adapting to religion in a time of coronavirus after a clampdown across the entire country was imposed to slow Europe’s worst outbreak. Last Saturday, the Italian government issued a decree locking down much of the north, where the virus first broke out, and severely restricted indoor activities in the rest of the country. So on Sunday, Father Riccardo Lamba of the parish of San Ponziano, in a modern Rome neighborhood, took matters into his own hands. He moved the Mass outdoors and said it from the steps of his modern church. About 70 parishioners sat on plastic chairs with space between them and those who stood did so in formation as if they were about to take a gym class. Slideshow ( 2 images ) The government later took measures restricting outdoor gatherings. Lamba said he has not decided what he will do this Sunday. “We are praying. Many people are entering the church to pray during the day but trying to keep apart,” he said on Tuesday. His parish is not alone. Even St. Peter’s Basilica was eerily almost empty on Tuesday after the Vatican said only faithful who wanted to pray would be allowed in. Tourists and guided groups would not be allowed until at least April 3. “We are living day to day to see what happens. Sometimes the government changes its mind in a matter of hours,” Lamba said. “Thank God the hard-core faithful can watch a Mass on TV.” Church weddings have been blocked until at least April 3. The trickle down effect has hit the wedding planner industry on the cusp of spring, its high season. “We have closed the office for now and have to wait and see how things develop,” said Sabrina Bucci, head of Esclusivevent, which organizes weddings in Rome’s churches and receptions in an ancient villa with a view of the dome of St. Peter’s Basilica. She said five weddings had been postponed indefinitely. The coronavirus crisis has also changed the way Catholics say farewell to their dearly departed. Since funerals in churches have been banned, bodies are being taken directly to cemeteries either from hospitals or homes, denying families a traditional rite of passage that brings people together. “This morning’s funeral could not be held. A priest came to the home to bless the body and we took it directly to the cemetery,” said Stefano Chiericoni, head of one of Rome’s best-known undertakers. “We are doing what the health authorities are telling us to do and, in any case, we are wearing masks and protective gowns,” he said.",fake
bc815fa3,"Florida GOP candidates for governor weigh in on school board term limits President Vladimir Putin held his annual end-of-year press conference on Thursday, answering questions from state media and independent journalists on an array of topics related to Russia's domestic and foreign policy. Here are the highlights from the marathon presser that lasted four hours and 19 minutes: On constitutional term limits for the presidency: — One thing that could be changed about these [presidential] terms is removing the clause about 'successive' [terms]. Your humble servant served two terms consecutively, then left his post, but with the constitutional right to return to the post of president again, because these two terms were not successive. [This clause] troubles some of our political analysts and public figures. Well, maybe it could be removed. On climate change: — “But we're not really sure why global warming is happening, but we need to do something about it.” — “We have the greenest energy system in the world. New industries have been created: liquefied natural gas, hydropower. Those who believe that we live on old resources are deeply mistaken.” On U.S. President Donald Trump’s impeachment: — You phrase your question as if Trump's presidency is coming to an end. I am not sure that's the case. [The impeachment bill] still needs to go through the Senate where Republicans as far as I know have a majority. It's unlikely they will want to remove from power a representative of their party based on what are, in my opinion, completely fabricated reasons. On Russia’s spat with Germany over the killing of an ex-Chechen rebel in Berlin: — “The issue of extraditing Khangoshvili was discussed at the level of our special services but there was no official request, because we knew that it would be refused.” — “This is an absolute bloody killer. He killed 98 people in the Caucasus — think about it. He participated in the attacks in the Moscow metro.” On the election of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson: — Johnson can be congratulated. He was victorious after all and had a better sense of the British public's mood than his political opponents. And as far as I understand, he intends to implement all of his Brexit plans. — In regards to [Russian] interference or non-interference, we've heard many times from official governing bodies in various countries, including Britain, assessments of what is happening inside Russia. Is that interference? On China: — We do not have a military alliance with China and we do not plan to create one. — But our relations with China continue to develop, including in the sphere of defence technologies... I think China is capable of producing its own ballistic missile early warning system, but with our help it can do so sooner. This will improve our strategic partner's ability to defend itself in a significant way. On the Libyan conflict: — Russia is in touch with [Libyan Prime Minister Fayez] al-Serraj and with [eastern Libyan commander Khalifa] Haftar. We are also constantly maintaining dialogue with our partners, including Turkey, Europe and other countries. — In our opinion, the best outcome would be for an agreement to be reached between the two conflicting sides that would lead to an end to military actions, and would establish who will rule the country, how, and what responsibilities they would have. On extending the New START arms control treaty with the U.S.: — We are ready until the end of the year to extend the existing agreement, the new START treaty. — But thus far there has been no answer to any of our suggestions. And without a new START treaty, there is nothing to curb an arms race. And that, in my opinion, is bad. On Russia’s doping scandal: — If WADA does not have any claims against our national Olympic Committee, then our team should be allowed to participate under its own flag. On Ukraine peace talks: — If a revision of the Minsk [peace] Agreements starts, then the situation could enter a complete dead end. — Direct dialogue on Donbass is needed. It is lacking. On internet freedom and the “foreign agents” law: — “Free internet and sovereign internet do not contradict each other. The [‘sovereign internet’] law is aimed only at preventing negative influence in case foreign resources are restricted.” — “We are not moving toward closing off the internet and are not going to do that.” — “It wasn’t us who coined the term ‘foreign agent.’ A similar law has been in force in the U.S. since the 1930s.”",partial
72eb0d0c,"Global Warming Is Driving Polar Bears Toward Extinction, Researchers Say In response to Gen David Petraeus' denunciation of Florida pastor Terry Jones' right to engage in a symbolic protest of the 9/11 attacks by burning copies of the Quran this Sept. 11, President Obama said: Let me be clear: As a citizen, and as president, I believe that members of the Dove World Outreach Center have the same right to freedom of speech and religion as anyone else in this country. Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida lauded Obama's remarks, saying America is a place where you're supposed to be able to practice your religion without the government telling you you can't. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg called Obama's words a clarion defense of the freedom of religion -- and also claimed that he had recently run into a filthy jihadist who actually supported the Quran-burning! Keith Olbermann read the poem First they came ... on air in defense of the Quran-burners, nearly bringing himself to tears at his own profundity. No wait, my mistake. This is what liberals said about the ground zero mosque only five minutes ago when they were posing as First Amendment absolutists. Suddenly, they've developed amnesia when it comes to the free-speech right to burn a Quran. Weirdly, conservatives who opposed building the mosque at ground zero are also against the Quran burning. (Except in my case. It turns out I'm for it, but mostly because burning Qurans will contribute to global warming.) Liberals couldn't care less about the First Amendment. To the contrary, censoring speech and religion is the left's specialty! (Any religion other than Islam.) They promote speech codes, hate crimes, free speech zones (known as America off college campuses), and go around the country yanking every reference to God from the public square via endless lawsuits by the ACLU. Whenever you see a liberal choking up over our precious constitutional rights, you can be sure we're talking about the rights of Muslims at ground zero, God Hates Fags funeral protesters, strippers, The New York Times publishing classified documents, pornographers, child molesters, murderers, traitors, saboteurs, terrorists, flag-burners (but not Quran-burners!) or women living on National Endowment of the Arts grants by stuffing yams into their orifices on stage. Speaking of lying dwarfs, last week on The Daily Show Bloomberg claimed he was having a hamburger with his girlfriend when a man came up to him and said of the ground zero mosque: I just got back from two tours fighting overseas for America. This is what we were all fighting for. You go and keep at it. We're fighting for the right of Muslims to build mosques at ground zero? I thought we were trying to keep Muslims AWAY from our skyscrapers. (What an embarrassing misunderstanding.) PLEASE PULL THE TROOPS OUT IMMEDIATELY. But back to the main issue: Was Bloomberg having a $150 Burger Double Truffle at DB Bistro Moderne or a more sensible $30 burger at the 21 Club when he bumped into his imaginary veteran? With the pint-sized mayor shrieking at the sight of a saltshaker, I assume he wasn't having a Hardee's No. 4 Combo Meal. Adding an element of realism to his little vignette, Bloomberg said: I got a hamburger and a pickle and a potato chip or something. A potato chip? Translation: I don't know what I was eating, because I'm making this whole story up -- I wouldn't be caught dead eating 'a potato chip' or any other picaresque garnish favored by the peasants. At least Bloomberg didn't claim the man who walked up to him took credit for setting the Times Square bomb because he was a tea partier upset about ObamaCare -- as Sherlock Bloomberg had so presciently speculated at the time. Gen. Petraeus objected to the Quran-burning protest on the grounds that it could be used by radical jihadists to recruit Muslims to attack Americans. This is what liberals say whenever we do anything displeasing to the enemy -- invade Iraq, hold captured terrorists in Guantanamo, interrogate captured jihadists or publish Muhammad cartoons. Is there a website somewhere listing everything that encourages terrorist recruiting? If the general's main objective is to hamper jihadist recruiting, may I respectfully suggest unconditional surrender? Because on his theory, you know what would really kill the terrorists' recruiting ability? If we adopted Sharia law! But wait -- weren't we assured by Fire Island's head of national security, Andrew Sullivan, that if America elected a brown-skinned man whose father was an African, who grew up in Indonesia and Hawaii, who attended a majority-Muslim school as a boy, the terrorists would look like a bunch of lunkheads and be unable to recruit? It didn't work out that way. There have been more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil by these allegedly calmed Muslims in Obama's first 18 months in office than in the six years under Bush after he invaded Iraq. Also, as I recall, there was no Guantanamo, no Afghanistan war and no Iraq war on Sept. 10, 2001. And yet, somehow, Osama bin Ladin had no trouble recruiting back then. Can we retire the it will help them recruit argument yet? The reason not to burn Qurans is that it's unkind -- not to jihadists, but to Muslims who mean us no harm. The same goes for building a mosque at ground zero -- in both cases, it's not a question of anyone's rights, it's just a nasty thing to do.",partial

Now we are in 2020, and the situation of wars, civil wars have not been solved and the situation got more worsed since then, if we took that report published by telegraph UK, I think more than 5 million have died so far due to starvation in Yemen in 2020, as the wars are on, COVID-19 is there, no trade and no money, not even single paracetamol is available as a medical aid to those helpless Muslims and their helpless and innocent children.

168e5898,"NHS fails thousands of new mothers with post-natal depression Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide has helped raise global food production and reduce poverty. National polls show that climate change is low on the list of voters’ priorities. For good reason: In the U.S., and for much of the world, the most dangerous environmental pollutants have been cleaned up. U.S. emissions of particulates, metals and varied gases—all of these: ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and sulfur—fell almost 70% between 1970 and 2014. Further reductions will come from improved technologies such as catalytic removal of oxides of nitrogen and more-efficient sulfur scrubbers. This is a boon to human health. But a myth persists that is both unscientific and immoral to perpetuate: that the beneficial gas carbon dioxide ranks among hazardous pollutants. It does not. Unlike genuine pollutants, carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless gas. Every human being exhales about two pounds of CO2 a day, along with a similar amount of water vapor. CO2 is nontoxic to people and animals and is a vital nutrient to plants. It is also a greenhouse gas which helps maintain earth at a habitable temperature. Fear of excessive warming from more CO2 in the atmosphere, including that released from human activity, has caused some people to advocate substantial and expensive reductions in CO2 emissions. But observations, such as those on our CO2 Coalition website, show that increased CO2 levels over the next century will cause modest and beneficial warming—perhaps as much as one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit)—and that this will be an even larger benefit to agriculture than it is now. The costs of emissions regulations, which will be paid by everyone, will be punishingly high and will provide no benefits to most people anywhere in the world.",other

2c6d2cf7,"Even the South Pole Is Warming, and Quickly, Scientists Say Trump official revises Statue of Liberty poem to defend migrant rule change Published 14 August 2019 image copyright Getty Images A top US immigration official has revised a quote inscribed on the Statue of Liberty in defence of a new policy that denies food aid to legal migrants. The head of Citizenship and Immigration Services tweaked the passage: Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. The official added the words who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge. He later said the poem had referred to people coming from Europe. Ken Cuccinelli, the Trump administration's acting head of Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced on Monday a new public charge requirement that limits legal migrants from seeking certain public benefits such as public housing or food aid, or are considered likely to do so in the future. image copyright Getty Images image caption The New Colossus was written by New York-born poet Emma Lazarus in 1883 The new regulation, known as a public charge rule, was published in the Federal Register on Monday and will take effect on 15 October. The rule change is intended to reinforce ideals of self-sufficiency, officials said. Critics argue that it will prevent low-income US residents from seeking help. What did the official say? On Tuesday, Mr Cuccinelli was asked by NPR whether the 1883 poem titled The New Colossus at the Statue of Liberty still applied. Would you also agree that Emma Lazarus's words etched on the Statue of Liberty, 'Give me your tired, give me your poor,' are also a part of the American ethos? asked NPR's Rachel Martin. image copyright Getty Images image caption Ken Cuccinelli, the acting head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services They certainly are, Mr Cuccinelli responded. Give me your tired and your poor - who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge. That plaque was put on the Statue of Liberty at almost the same time as the first public charge [law] was passed - very interesting timing, he added. The actual passage reads in part: Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door! In the interview, he added that immigrants are welcome who can stand on their own two feet, be self-sufficient, pull themselves up by their bootstraps, again, as in the American tradition. After the host asked if the policy appears to change the definition of the American dream, he said: We invite people to come here and join us as a privilege. No one has a right to become an American who isn't born here as an American. media caption Top immigration official says public charge rule will not target any particular group Mr Cuccinelli was pressed later on CNN about his comments, and pushed back on claims he was trying to re-write the poem. He insisted he was answering a question and accused people on the left of twisting his comments. Then asked by anchor Erin Burnett about what America stands for, he said: Of course that poem was referring back to people coming from Europe - where they had class-based societies where people were considering wretched if they weren't in the right class. The two then discussed their own immigrant ancestry, with Ms Burnett pointing out his rule would have excluded her family. I'm here because they were allowed in, and I'm an anchor on CNN, she said. Beto O'Rouke, a Democratic presidential hopeful from Texas, shared a clip from the interview and said the comments show his Trump administration think the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people. This administration finally admitted what we’ve known all along: They think the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people. https://t.co/kTLl50yCmw — Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) August 14, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter Who will be affected by the new rule? Immigrants who are already permanent residents in the US are unlikely to be affected by the rule change. It also does not apply to refugees and asylum applicants. But applicants for visa extensions, green cards or US citizenship will be subject to the change. Those who do not meet income standards or who are deemed likely to rely on benefits such as Medicaid (government-run healthcare) or housing vouchers in future may be blocked from entering the country. Those already in the US could also have their applications rejected. An estimated 22 million legal residents in the US are without citizenship, and many of these are likely to be affected. President Trump has made immigration a central theme of his administration. This latest move is part of his government's efforts to curb legal immigration. What has reaction been? The Democratic led House Homeland Security Committee condemned Mr Cuccinelli's revision in a tweet, calling the words vile and un-American. It's clear the Trump Administration just wants to keep certain people out, the committee wrote, calling Mr Cuccinelli a xenophobic, anti-immigrant fringe figure who has no business being in government. Others pointed to his background as the attorney general of Virginia, in which he led a conservative campaign against immigration and homosexuality. Asked about Mr Cuccinelli's remarks on Tuesday, President Trump did not directly respond to the Statue of Liberty quote, but said: I don't think it's fair to have the American taxpayer pay for people to come into the United States. I'm tired of seeing our taxpayer paying for people to come into the country and immediately go onto welfare and various other things.",fake

The adviser replied by saying that the American “response will include a mix of tools seen and unseen.” He didn’t specify what those ‘tools’ might be.

38a5453c,"Justine Greening quits government after refusing offer of new role Dan O’Donnell dives into new data from the Wisconsin Elections Commission that shows a stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots this November. February 3, 2021 Perspective by Dan O’Donnell Calling into question any aspect of November’s presidential election is a dangerous proposition these days. One is liable to be banned from social media or blamed for a riot at the U.S. Capitol even for suggesting that there might be irregularities that warrant further investigation. It is, however, far from conspiracy-mongering to accept the reality that those in charge of administering state elections here in Wisconsin put their thumb on the scales at every conceivable opportunity. The Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) violated state law by refusing to remove 234,000 names from the voter rolls and by keeping both Kanye West and the Green Party off the ballot so that they could not serve as spoilers for eventual winner Joe Biden. Milwaukee and Dane County clerks violated state law by telling voters that they could claim indefinite confinement (and thus avoid voter ID requirements) even if they themselves were not actually confined to their homes. The City of Madison violated state law by holding a ballot harvesting event (for which the Biden campaign actually advertised) in every one of its city parks. Now it seems likely that elections officials across the state refused to reject ballots that they normally would have (and probably legally should have). The WEC’s newly released Election Data Report reveals a staggering anomaly that is nearly impossible to otherwise explain: Despite a massive increase in the use of mail-in voting this November, the percentage of ballots that were rejected dropped to nearly zero. Just 4,270 absentee ballots out of 1,969,274 cast were rejected—a rate of 0.2%. This defies both logic and common sense. In November’s presidential election, there were roughly twice as many absentee ballots cast as in the spring 2016 election, yet in that election four years ago the rejection rate was 2.5%. If far more people were casting absentee ballots (and presumably casting them for the first time), it would stand to reason that the number of mistakes which cause ballots to be rejected would increase as well. Instead, those mistakes all but vanished. An infinitesimal 0.07% of ballots (1,434 in total) were rejected because of insufficient ballot certification. An even smaller 0.05% (1,045 total) were rejected because they were received after polls closed. And a microscopic 0.002% (just 42 total) were rejected because the ballot envelope was somehow compromised. This is nearly impossible to explain, especially since the ballot rejection rate was 1.8% just seven months earlier in Wisconsin’s spring election, when a then-record 1,101,474 absentee ballots were cast. Despite a 78% increase in the number of absentee ballots cast in November, there was a 78% decrease in the number of ballots that were rejected. Did hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites suddenly figure out how to correctly fill out their ballots? Or was there a concerted effort to count as many ballots as possible without regard to whether they were correctly filled out? The evidence points toward the latter. The ballot rejection rate in the April 2016 presidential primary was 2.5% with a 1.4% rejection rate the following November even though there were far fewer absentee ballots returned than in the 2020 presidential election cycle. The April 2020 rejection rate was well within the normal range at 1.8%, but then it suddenly dipped to a minuscule 0.2%. Interestingly enough, in the November 2018 gubernatorial election—which was also dogged by allegations of fraud following a sudden influx of absentee votes in Milwaukee that propelled Governor Tony Evers past Scott Walker—the absentee ballot rejection rate suddenly dropped to 0.2%. What exactly would be the odds that ballots suddenly stopped getting rejected in the two statewide races in which unpopular Republicans (Walker and Donald Trump) were on the ballot and both lost because of huge increases in absentee voting? Given that the Wisconsin Elections Commission has since 2016 been unlawfully telling local clerks to fix problematic ballots instead of returning them to voters as state statutes require, it seems as though it has been WEC policy (unlawful though it may be) to get as many questionable ballots counted as possible. This, however, doesn’t explain the sudden and dramatic dips in ballot rejection rates only in the 2018 gubernatorial and 2020 presidential elections. Either voters somehow figured out ballot return rules exceptionally well only in those two races or clerks and poll workers had a concerted effort to reject as few ballots as possible in an unlawful attempt at aiding Democrat challengers in their bid to unseat Republican incumbents whom the clerks and poll workers despised. Either way, this stunningly low rejection rate with a record number of mail-in ballots demands and immediate and thorough investigation.",fake
ca53fa81,"Pastor Dies After 30 Days of Fasting To Beat Jesus Record SHARE By of the Sun Prairie - With the economy still struggling and his own political prospects in the balance, Gov. Scott Walker said Wednesday he would seek a bipartisan approach on a second special session of jobs bills. Saying lawmakers should focus on jobs like a laser beam, Walker said he wanted to pass by November roughly 30 bills written by both Republicans and Democrats and targeting everything from biotech companies to farm and trucking businesses. But consumer advocates and Democrats immediately raised red flags on some of the legislation, noting that one bill would require families and small businesses to subsidize lower power rates for large manufacturers, other bills were still just drafts, and some - which would loosen regulations on everything from piers to wetlands - wouldn't necessarily create any jobs. For now, the special session doesn't include the two highest-profile pieces of economic development legislation - a bill to boost venture capital investments and another to rewrite the state's mining regulations and permitting process. We just want to make it easier for all the people who want to come and grow and expand in Wisconsin . . . to get away from all the other stuff, all the other subjects debated around the Capitol that distract us from this, Walker said, speaking at the firm Thermal Spray Technologies. In his speech, Walker struck a conciliatory tone, noting that many jobs bills in a January special session received bipartisan support. The call to refocus on jobs follows a spring dominated by a divisive debate over the Republican governor's repeal of most union bargaining for public workers and a summer overshadowed by recall elections against nine state senators for their stances on that legislation. So far the disagreements are lingering, with Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau) taking the unusual step on Tuesday of refusing to appoint to a mining committee the senators recommended by Minority Leader Mark Miller (D-Monona). This year, the economic picture in Wisconsin and the country has been mixed. The state created a net total of 30,100 jobs between December and August, after accounting for seasonal differences in hiring, but the unemployment rate has risen to 7.9% from 7.5%. Democrats welcomed the focus on jobs but questioned whether some of the bills, such as one that dealt with piers and others to limit lawsuits, would accomplish that goal. They asked whether the bills should be part of a special session that allows them to be potentially moved more quickly. We want to see bills rushed that will create jobs. We want to see bills slowed down that do not have any promise for creating jobs now, said Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca (D-Kenosha), who has one of the bills on the list. Power rates The bill on utility discounts is being touted by Republican lawmakers as a tool to help Wisconsin's economy grow. The bill would expand a pilot program to offer a discount of nearly $5 million over five years to Mercury Marine, the final piece of a more than $120 million state-and-local financing package that helped the Fond du Lac engine maker decide not to move to Oklahoma. Charlie Higley, executive director of the ratepayers group Citizens' Utility Board, objected to a news release by Walker's office that referred to the bill as tax relief, saying that it dealt with utility rates and had nothing to do with taxes. Higley said that the proposed lower rates for certain large manufacturers would end up being paid for by what is essentially a hidden fee on other consumers. That's been prohibited for over 100 years because it's simply unfair to make ratepayers pay for discounts that go to other ratepayers, Higley said. A trade association of the state's largest power consumers backed the proposal. The bill would increase our competitiveness and help job creation efforts in Wisconsin. Many other regulated states across the country offer similar programs as part of their economic development tool kits, said Todd Stuart, executive director of the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group. The announcement highlighting the bill Wednesday came one day before the state Public Service Commission, controlled by two Walker appointees, is scheduled to vote on whether to award the utility bill discounts to Mercury Marine. Discounts for the engine maker were announced as part of a package that included funding from the state, county and city to persuade Mercury not to move its manufacturing from Wisconsin to Stillwater, Okla. The company ended up receiving $122.7 million in state, county, federal stimulus and local funding, but Alliant's request for Mercury to receive a rate break was never authorized. It has been challenged by the Citizens' Utility Board but supported by Stuart's group. At a May public hearing on the utility rate bill, We Energies and the Municipal Electric Utilities of Wisconsin joined CUB in raising concerns about the impact the utility rate legislation would have on small businesses, which would be funding discounts for larger ones. But Wisconsin Power & Light and manufacturers backed the bill, saying it would help Wisconsin attract businesses by giving it a tool that other states, including Iowa and Minnesota, have. Rep. Mark Honadel (R-South Milwaukee) said Wednesday the bill is being revised to address concerns raised at the hearing. Another proposal highlighted by Walker Wednesday would create a program to make grants and loans to biotech companies. Those would be paid for by redirecting the growth in income taxes withheld by businesses in that sector for their workers. That draft legislation would be capped at $50 million a year and run for 15 years or $500 million over the life of the program. Wetlands bill Walker's list also included draft legislation to allow for construction on wetlands if new wetlands are created in other locations. Rep. Brett Hulsey (D-Madison) said that he believes the draft bill would make it easier to allow so-called wetland mitigation - moving wetlands from one spot to another. He said he feared it was a backdoor effort to help mining company Gogebic Taconite of Hurley, which is proposing to construct a large iron ore mine in Ashland and Iron counties. But opponents of the current law say that the Department of Natural Resources has long inhibited commercial development by restricting what can be done on wetlands. Dan Johnson, an aide to Sen. Neal Kedzie (R-Elkhorn), a co-sponsor of the legislation, said the wetlands bill has nothing to do with mining. Another draft bill would make changes in how Wisconsin regulates the construction and size of piers on public waterways and grandfather in all existing docks on lakes and rivers. Pier regulation has also been controversial, with the DNR under the administration of former Gov. Jim Doyle saying that changes were needed to protect the sensitive shore area of water bodies and property owners saying they should be able to keep long-standing piers. Regulations approved in 2008 grandfathered most but not all piers, when the state set new standards on the size of new docks. This spring, the Legislature allowed pier owners one more year to meet the deadline to comply with the 2008 regulations. The new deadline is April 1, 2012. Democrats such as Barca questioned how that proposal could create any jobs at all. Walker spokesman Chris Schrimpf said that it was a measure to streamline regulation that has been worked on for a long time and made sense to be introduced as part of an overall package.

Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice NHS hospital beds numbers have plunged by 20% over the past decade and left the health service at “breaking point”, the British Medical Association warned. Analysis by the BMA found the number of overnight beds in English hospitals fell by a fifth between 2006/7 and 2015/16. BMA chairman Mark Porter said: “The UK already has the second lowest number of hospital beds per head in Europe per head ,and these figures paint an even bleaker picture of an NHS that is at breaking point. “High bed occupancy is a symptom of wider pressure and demand on an overstretched and underfunded system. It causes delays in admissions, operations being cancelled and patients being unfairly and sometimes repeatedly let down.” The BMA’s new report found that in the first week of January this year, almost three-quarters of trusts had a bed occupancy rate of 95% on at least one day. According to the analysis, in 2000 there were an average of 3.8 beds per 1,000 people, but this had dropped to 2.4 beds by 2015. Image: Universal Images Group The report said that in November 2016, 14.8% of patients spent more than four hours waiting for a hospital bed, having been seen in an A&E department. “The data demonstrates the increasing pressures on the system,” Dr Porter said. “It provides evidence of the underlying cracks within the NHS, such as funding constraints, changes and increases in demand, disjointed care and workforce pressures,” the BMA report said. It noted that pressures on mental health services were particularly acute, with a 44% decrease in the number of mental health beds since 2000/01. The document was seized on by opposition politicians, with Labour saying it was a “wake-up call which Theresa May must not ignore” and the Liberal Democrats warning the situation was becoming “intolerable”. Image: Moment RF Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “Thanks to Tory mishandling of our NHS, patient numbers in hospitals are now routinely above the levels recommended for safety. The shameful reality is this overcrowding puts patients at risk and blows apart ministers’ claims to be prioritising safety. “The number of overnight hospital beds has decreased by over a fifth, and combined with Tory neglect and underfunding this has left nine out of 10 hospitals dangerously overcrowded this winter.” Lib Dem spokesman and former health minister Norman Lamb added: “Chronic bed shortages should be the exception not the rule. “The situation is getting intolerable, with more cancelled operations, longer delays and those with mental health issues being systematically let down. “The Government is failing to properly fund the NHS and patients are paying the price.” A NHS Improvement spokeswoman said: “The NHS has been under real pressure this winter, as it copes with a surge in demand for emergency services the knock-on effects are felt throughout our hospitals. “Our hospitals are extremely busy but we are working tirelessly alongside providers to help them manage and to support more efficient use of the number of beds available.”",partial
5ce4da20,"Photographer reveals story behind iconic image of fleeing migrants at Mexico border After 35 days of being replaced for vandalism, the memorial sign of Emmett Till has been filled with bullet holes again. What We Know: The Emmett Till memorial was put up by the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, and resides outside of Glendale, Mississippi. According to TIME Magazine, this is the third time that the sign has been vandalized. To drive up and see it like that, I was sad,” said Patrick Weems, a founder of the Emmett Till Interpretive Center in Sumner, Miss. “When we finally replaced it, it was an amazing feeling that this sign that had been obliterated was finally restored.” The memorial was placed in honor of 14-year-old Till who was lynched, beaten and tortured by two white men, and then thrown in the Tallahatchie river. He was accused by a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, of whistling at her. The men where acquitted of his murder, and she recanted her story decades later after Till’s death. It was not until 2007, 52 years after Till’s death that he received his first memorial sign. It only lasted one year, before the sign was stolen and never returned, New York Times reports. Several signs have been replaced since the first one was stolen. Another was also shot, and the newest sign was replaced in June. No one has ever been caught for vandalizing the signs, but Mr. Weems says, “My sense is that it only takes one person to do this.” Mr. Weems says that there are talks of a new sign being being designed and made out of steel to be better than before. The Emmett Till foundation continues it’s journey to preserve his legacy.",other
dd4501d6,"Large proportion of those referred to UK deradicalisation scheme are under 18 The rookie politician’s first month looks a lot like his campaign. Congressman Conor Lamb was an unknown quantity when he won a special election in March that he wasn’t supposed to win, having run as a Democrat even Reaganites could love and refusing to fully toe the partisan line. It was a question of how all that would translate in elected office. He had no political experience and no voting record to point to and only platform points and campaign vows to serve as reference material. A month later, and that has changed. In the first weeks of what is to be a very brief term representing the 18th Congressional District — portions of which belong to Allegheny, Westmoreland, Greene and Washington counties — Lamb has voted with his fellow Democrats in the House and at times with the Republican majority. He’s voted in favor of measures to extend hate crime protections to law enforcement officers and against a Farm Bill containing controversial new work requirements for food stamp recipients. He’s voted with Congressman Keith Rothfus, Lamb’s Republican opponent in the ongoing race for Pennsylvania’s newly drawn 17th Congressional District, and against him. So the question is: If Lamb was billed as a political maverick, a moderate in immoderate times, does his voting record reflect that? Here we look at the votes cast by Lamb in his first weeks in office and preview what his votes might look like as a more permanent member of the U.S. House if he’s elected to represent the 17th in November. Multiple requests for comment were not returned. Legislation U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb - Democrat U.S. Rep.

The Volcker Rule was passed as part of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 under President Barack Obama and was meant to protect bank customers by preventing institutions from making certain types of speculative investments that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. According to the New York Times, “the Volcker Rule, named for the former chairman of the Federal Reserve […] prohibited banks from making their own risky bets with their customers’ deposits. Banks loathed the rule and Republicans vowed to undo it.” The bill works by allowing thousands of small and midsize banks to avoid tougher oversight and, per the Washington Post, “also loosens rules aimed at protecting the biggest banks from sudden collapse.” The Post also reported that Paul Volcker, the former Fed chairman for whom the rule is named, criticized a similar bill in the U.S. Senate, saying “plausibly small loopholes can be ‘gamed’ and exploited with unfortunate consequences.” In the end, congressional Republicans succeeded with the help of Democrats like Lamb who was one of 78 Democrats to vote for the rollback. One hundred and fifteen Democrats cast votes against the rule change or didn’t vote at all, according to govtrack.us. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted to rollback the rule and later said at a town hall that his vote was based on the burden the regulation presented for smaller banks that he said don’t engage in the type of risky trading that the big banks did before the financial crisis of 2008, TribLive reported. Under the bill, community banks are defined as those without a controlling entity with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and trading liability that are more than 5 percent of total consolidated assets. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus also voted in favor of the rollback. Where does it stand? The bill was passed by the House and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, according to congress.gov. S. 2155 – Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act What is it? The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act is a more sweeping rollback of Dodd-Frank provisions. It aims to “ease the regulatory burden for small and midsize banks,” the same banks that argue the tougher regulations spurred by the 2008 financial crisis have unfairly made it more difficult for them to operate and compete. This includes community banks whose customers include small businesses, which critics of Dodd-Frank argue have been hurt by curtailed lending to small companies following the passage of Dodd-Frank in 2010. Critics of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, meanwhile, argue that it could embolden some of the financial sector’s worst tendencies, the same that contributed to or caused the financial collapse of 2008. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against the measure, joining the vast majority of Democrats. In a press release, Lamb said of the bill: “With common-sense regulations in place to protect the money that consumers deposit, people can have more confidence that their bank will better protect their investments. Banks today are experiencing record-setting profits and it’s only fair that we continue to protect the interests of the taxpayers and avoid another bailout.” WESA described this as Lamb “straddling the partisan divide with two votes on bank rules.” How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus voted for the measure, joining almost all of his fellow Republicans. In a statement, Rothfus said: “Since the end of the financial crisis, we have seen an average of one community bank or credit union disappear every day. This has meant that consumers have faced higher costs and reduced access to vital financial products. By fixing misguided rules from Washington, this bill will help consumers and small businesses access the financial services they need to live their version of the American Dream.” Where does it stand? President Trump signed the bill into law Thursday. H.R. 5698 – Protect and Serve Act of 2018 What is it? The Protect and Serve Act of 2018 is modeled after a federal hate crime statute and would make it a crime to intentionally target a law enforcement officer based on his “actual or perceived status” as one, CNN reports. Supporters say the bill sends a clear signal that violence against law enforcement officers will not be tolerated. Critics say the language of the bill is too broad and effectively designates any violence against officers a federal hate crime. They also argue that it perpetuates a false narrative of a “war on police” and that police already have substantial protections under state and federal law and do not qualify as a historically persecuted group. How did Lamb vote? Lamb, whose background as a federal prosecutor and Marine Corps JAG officer were regular features of his campaign, voted in favor of the bill. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He was one of 162 Democrats to vote in favor of the bill, while 24 voted against it and seven didn’t vote, according to govtrack.us. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus also voted in favor of the measure. There were 220 Republicans who cast yes votes for the legislation, 11 who did not, and three who didn’t vote at all. All of the bill’s sponsors were Republicans. Where does it stand? The bill passed the House and has been referred to the Senate’s Committee on the Judiciary. H.R. 2152 – Citizens’ Right to Know Act of 2018 What is it? This bill requires a state or local government that receives funds under a Department of Justice (DOJ) grant program and uses such funds for a pretrial services program to annually report to DOJ the amount of money allocated for the pretrial services program and certain information about participating defendants. DOJ must publish the information. Additionally, DOJ must reduce the grant allocation of a state or local government that fails to comply. Supporters argue the bill would provide greater transparency in how federal funds are used by local governments. Critics, including the ACLU, NAACP and Human Rights Watch, say the bill presents “serious privacy concerns” and also “undermines efforts to eliminate or reduce jurisdictions’ reliance on money bail systems.” How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against the measure, joining a majority of Democrats. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus voted yes, along with all but 8 Republican voters in the House. What happened? The bill passed the House and has been referred to the Senate’s Committee on the Judiciary. H.R. 5645 – Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2018 What is it? According to Law 360: The SMARTER Act would eliminate differences between the DOJ and FTC’s approaches to merger challenges by requiring the FTC to litigate contested merger challenges in federal court, rather than through its administrative review process. Proponents of the SMARTER Act argue that it provides greater certainty for companies by reconciling the disparate processes used by the FTC and DOJ. Opponents view the proposal as an attack on the FTC’s ability to properly carry out its duties, unnecessarily weakening the FTC by removing this enforcement tool from its powers. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against the measure, joining all but four Democrats. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus voted in favor of the measure in what amounted to a party-line vote. Where does it stand? H.R. 5645 passed the House and was referred to the Senate’s Committee on the Judiciary. H.R. 2: Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (Farm Bill) What is it? The Farm Bill is a multi-year spending bill covering an array of agricultural and food programs — everything from farm commodity price and income supports, agricultural conservation, farm credit, trade, research, rural development, bioenergy, foreign food aid, and domestic nutrition assistance, the Congressional Research Service reports. This year’s proposal was controversial for its proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the proposed addition of work requirements for SNAP recipients. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against the measure with all 183 Democrats who cast votes May 18. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus also voted no, joining only 30 Republican lawmakers who opposed the measure. “While this bill began necessary reforms to agriculture and nutrition programs, in an era of a nearly $21 trillion national debt, more reforms are needed,” Rothfus said in a statement. “Congress needs to be very careful in how it spends hard-earned taxpayer dollars. This bill was a missed opportunity for serious reforms of agricultural subsidy programs.” Of the 30 Republicans to vote no on the Farm Bill proposal, NPR reports many are members of the House Freedom Caucus and that they voted no after failing to get concessions on spending and a future vote on immigration in exchange for their support. Rothfus was a member of the House Freedom Caucus until resigning in 2016. Where does the bill stand? The bill failed in the House in a 198-213 and has yet to be scheduled for further proceedings. H.R. 3053 – Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2018 What is it? H.R. 3053 is a bill to authorize the Department of Energy to resume a plan — halted under the Obama administration — to build the Yucca Mountain facility to store radioactive nuclear waste. Supporters of H.R. 3053 say waste is piling up at power plants nationwide because Yucca Mountain is unavailable. Critics point to safety concerns and “government bullying” in explaining their opposition. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted for the bill to restart the program, joining 221 Republicans and 119 members of his own party. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus also voted in favor of the bill. Where does it stand? Referred to Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. H.R. 3144 – To provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified period of time, and for other purposes What is it? The bill, sponsored by U.S. Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Spokane, would reverse a federal judge’s order calling for more springtime spill over on dams along the Columbia and Snake Rivers in the Northwest to protect endangered salmon. The bill would lock in place management plans that the judge found violated federal environmental laws, according to High Country News. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against it along with 181 out of a total 189 voting Democrats. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus voted for the measure, joining all but 8 Republican voters in the House. Where does it stand? The bill passed the House and has been referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.",partial

It other words, our doctrine provides for no right to preemptive strike, Peskov stressed, adding that Russia reserves the right to a nuclear strike only in case it is attacked with the use of nuclear weapons or attacked in a way that jeopardizes the mere existence of the state.

But if we come under attack, then everyone will go where he or she should - either to heaven or to hell, or elsewhere. This is what he meant, the rest was allegory, he said.

5a2459c3,"Late diagnosis of lung cancer hitting survival rate, study says A measure to limit Florida school board member terms has gained the support of the two men seeking the Republican nomination to become the state's next governor. They did not weigh in, though, on the other two provisions the concept is tied to as it heads to the November ballot. U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, a Jacksonville Republican in his third term, isn't one to talk much about Florida-specific issues. He did, however, take time to publicize his position on school board term limits, perhaps the most popular of the three ideas in the constitutional amendment. It also asks voters to require civics literacy program in public schools, and to allow the Legislature to create new education models outside the control of local school boards. No elected office, whether federal or local, is ever better off when run by career politicians, DeSantis, a three-term House member from Jacksonville, wrote in a piece for the U.S. Term Limits website. That's why I support eight-year term limits for all school board members, continued DeSantis, who also has sponsored legislation to limit Congressional terms. I am confident this proposal would bring new energy and ideas to school boards, which too often suffer from the same untamed incumbency that paralyzes Congress. Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, by most accounts a the candidate more likely to focus on policy details, shared that point of view. If term limits are good enough for the governor and the Legislature, they're good enough for school boards, Putnam said via email. Supporters of Amendment 8, the Constitution Revision Commission's education-focused ballot question, have focused attention on the term limits portion. The new political committee backing the measure this week referred to the proposal in its press release as being about school board term limits and other K-12 policy. It's that other part that has opponents most concerned. They have taken to social media to complain that the section amending Section 4 of Article IX of the State Constitution to specify which schools are operated, controlled, and supervised by a school board could establish a second level of public schools run without local control, with appointed boards based in Tallahassee or elsewhere. The original language, before the Constitution Revision Commission amended it, spoke directly of a state charter school authorizer. Only later did the commission change the wording to be more general.",partial
96b47cba,"Affordable Housing Impact Statements could guide policy in Atlanta White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday repeatedly deflected reporters’ questions about gun control, saying “there will certainly be a time for that policy discussion to take place, but that’s not the place that we’re in at this moment.” During the same media briefing, however, Sanders weighed in on the exact “policy discussion” that she said the White House would not engage in on “a day of mourning.” “I think one of the things that we don’t want to do is try to create laws that won’t create — or stop these types of things from happening,” Sanders said. “I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn’t helped there. So, I think we have to, when that time comes for those conversations to take place, then I think we have to look at things that may actually have a real impact.” This is the White House not talking about gun control. Here’s how frustrated Democrats have responded to Las Vegas As fact checkers have consistently pointed out, the claim that Chicago has “the strictest gun laws in the country” — one that Trump himself used in a presidential debate last fall — is outdated and has not been true since 2013. It is true, however, that the city’s gun-control regulations remain among the strictest in the nation, yet there were 4,368 shooting victims in Chicago last year, and there have been 2,877 this year. Later, Sanders responded to Hillary Clinton’s suggestion that a House bill that would ease restrictions on gun silencers could make attacks like the one Stephen Paddock carried out in Las Vegas even more deadly by dampening an audible cue that alerts potential targets. “I haven’t spoken with the president about that specific issue, but I don’t think that that is something that would have changed” the outcome, Sanders said. (An expert The Washington Post’s Philip Bump consulted suggests Sanders is probably right on this point.) “Again, I think before we start trying to talk about the preventions of what took place last night we need to know more facts,” Sanders continued. “And right now, we’re simply not at that point. It’s very easy for Mrs. Clinton to criticize and to come out, but I think we need to remember the only person with blood on their hands is that of the shooter.” During the briefing, NBC’s Hallie Jackson noted that “after the Orlando shooting, the president that day was out on Twitter talking about policy; he was talking about his travel ban.” Jackson was right: It is hard for the White House to say the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting is not the time to talk about policy because of the precedent set by Trump. Apparently it also is hard for Trump’s team to resist talking about policy, even when it insists that “today is a day for consoling the survivors and mourning those we lost.” There is nothing inherently wrong with Sanders stating the president’s positions on gun control. Democrats are certainly declaring their own. But the idea that the White House refuses to discuss the issue so soon after tragedy does not match reality.",fake
53eabb9b,"HUGE BREAKING NEWS IN GEORGIA – 132,000 Ballots in Fulton County, Georgia Have Been Identified Which Are Likely Ineligible Trade agreements and pressure on India’s ‘pharmacy of the developing world’ pose major threats to access Durban, 21 July 2016 — The international medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières today released the 18th edition of its HIV drug pricing report, Untangling the Web of Antiretroviral Price Reductions, at the International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa. The report finds that prices of older HIV drugs continue to decline, while newer drugs remain largely priced out of reach. This is in large part because pharmaceutical corporations maintain monopolies that block price-lowering generic competition. Today, the lowest available price for a quality-assured, World Health Organization-recommended first-line one-pill-a-day combination is US$100 per person per year (tenofovir/emtricitabine/efavirenz). This is a decrease of 26% since MSF last recorded the lowest price for first-line treatment at $136 in 2014. For a WHO-recommended second-line regimen, the lowest available price is now $286 per person per year (zidovudine/lamivudine + atazanavir/ritonavir)—an 11% decrease from $322 two years ago. These prices continue to fall as a result of robust competition among generics manufacturers in key producing countries, primarily India. But the price of newer drugs—needed for people who have run out of other HIV treatment options—remain high, largely because of patent monopolies held by drug corporations. The lowest price for salvage treatment today is $1,859 per person per year (raltegravir + darunavir/ritonavir + etravirine). This is more than 18 times the price of first-line therapy, and more than six times the price of today’s most affordable second-line combination. The price for this combination has come down only by seven percent, from $2,006 per year in 2014. These are the lowest global prices, but many countries, especially ‘middle-income’ countries, pay much higher prices for these medicines because pharmaceutical patents block them from using generics.  the price of newer drugs—needed for people who have run out of other HIV treatment options—remain high, largely because of patent monopolies held by drug corporations. “We have to be able to afford the newer HIV drug combinations that people will need over time, or else they will have no other options,” said Dr. Vivian Cox, Medical Referent for MSF’s Eshowe project in South Africa “We need to be shouting about this now to make sure we don’t end up with another treatment crisis like the one we faced over a decade ago, when life-saving medicines were simply priced out of reach for millions of people who needed them.” While today the number of people who require salvage therapy is still relatively small in developing countries, the increased use of gold-standard viral load treatment monitoring is helping identify more people who are failing on their first- or second-line treatment and need to be switched to another set of medicines. Already in MSF’s HIV programmes, the number of people having moved to second-line therapy has almost doubled since 2013. India, the world’s main producer of affordable HIV medicines, is often called the ‘pharmacy of the developing world.’ More than 97% of the HIV medicines MSF uses in its treatment programmes are generic medicines from India. India’s patent law sets a high bar for what deserves a patent. This allows robust competition among generic producers, which has driven down first-line HIV treatment prices by 99% -- from $10,000 per person per year in 2000, to $100 today. But India is facing immense pressure to roll back its pro-health patent policies—which put people’s lives over corporate profits—especially from the United States, backed by its pharmaceutical corporation lobby. Other countries, such as the EU, along with Japan and South Korea, are preparing or actively pursuing trade agreements with India that would restrict the country’s production of affordable medicines in the future. Should India be forced to change its policies for these trade agreements, it could pose a serious threat to affordable medicines production in India. “India is under massive pressure to turn off its tap of affordable medicines, which are a lifeline to millions of people not only in India, but across the developing world,” said Leena Menghaney, South Asia Head of MSF’s Access Campaign. “If India doesn’t stand strong against the pharmaceutical corporations and governments that are pushing for change in the country’s patent law and policies, people around the world will face a crisis in access to medicines in the future.

Millions of people in developing countries could be affected if India caves in to pressure.",partial
905519d3,"Renationalising railways supported by almost two thirds of Britons, exclusive poll reveals Diabetes prescriptions are costing the NHS in England more than £1 billion a year, according to figures from NHS Digital. The total cost of the prescriptions has risen significantly - by more than £422 million - in the last 10 years. Almost one in 20 prescriptions written by GPs are now for diabetes treatment. The biggest increases are seen in treatments for type 2 diabetes, which affects around 90% of diabetes patients. Robin Hewings, head of policy at the charity Diabetes UK, said the figures reflect a dramatic rise in the incidence of diabetes. The number of people diagnosed with diabetes has doubled in the last 20 years, and it is responsible for 26,000 early deaths per year alongside serious complications such as blindness, amputation or stroke. This data shows that diabetes prescribing costs £1bn, but it is estimated that the total cost to the NHS is over £10bn a year, so the real price we have to pay for diabetes is not medications, but the devastating and expensive complications. Mr Hewings pointed out that drug costs have not risen significantly during this period, and that the increase in prescribing costs is largely a result of the rise in prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes signs 'detectable years earlier' 'Postcode lottery' for diabetes monitors Diabetes 'info prescription' plan Presentational grey line The rise in diabetes There are now over three million people in England with a diagnosis of diabetes. The number has doubled over the last two decades and there are nearly 100,000 diagnoses per year. 92% of recorded diagnoses of diabetes relate to type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes, unlike type 1, is closely linked to lifestyle factors and is preventable through lifestyle change. Almost seven out of 10 men are overweight or obese 66.8% and almost six out of 10 women are overweight or obese 57.8% in England. Source: NHS England Presentational grey line Type 2 diabetes is caused by the body not producing enough insulin, or by the body's cells not reacting to the insulin that is present, resulting in high blood sugar. It may be controlled by diet, or by antidiabetic drugs or insulin, or both. Type 2 is caused by a variety of factors, some of which are out of people's control, but more than 80 percent is caused by obesity or being overweight. In overweight and obese people, type 2 diabetes can be prevented and reversed by losing weight. The NHS England figures also include the cost of devices used by people with diabetes to monitor their condition. Nearly £477 million was spent on antidiabetic drugs in 2017-18. Over the same year, around £350 million was spent on insulin, and £181 million on diagnostic and monitoring devices. Professor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity at NHS England, said: Thanks to better diagnosis and treatment, the NHS is caring for more people than ever before with diabetes, and this new data highlights the urgent need to prevent type 2 diabetes from developing in the first place. The NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme has now reached over a quarter of a million people at high risk of type 2 diabetes.",other
da910b12,"Addressing the Heartbreak of Addiction As a father, I have felt the heartbreak of drug abuse. My daughter Noelle suffered from addiction, and like many parents facing similar situations, her mom and I struggled to help. I have so many friends and know so many families who have faced this terrible challenge. Addiction crosses all barriers, all lines, all races and all incomes. It creates real hardship and heartbreak in families. And, it places substantial demands on government at every level. I never expected to see my precious daughter in jail. It wasn’t easy, and it became very public when I was Governor of Florida, making things even more difficult for Noelle. She went through hell, so did her mom, and so did I. It’s very debilitating when you have a loved one who is struggling, and you can’t control it. You have to love them, but you also have to make it clear you cannot enable the behavior that gets them in trouble. Showing a lot of courage, Noelle graduated from drug court. Drug courts use a restorative solution model involving multi-disciplinary coordination, including the judiciary, the prosecution, mental health specialists, social services and treatment professionals. I was the proud dad that saw Noelle finish that. She’s drug-free now. As Governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent. As President, I will lead this country to dramatically reduce drug abuse. The country’s massive heroin and illicit drug epidemic is compounded and fueled by sharp increases in the abuse of prescription painkillers. The problem is exacerbated by huge increases in the availability of cheap, highly potent heroin, primarily the result of Mexican drug cartels getting involved in the production, trafficking and distribution of heroin and other illicit drugs. Some label the drug abuse epidemic just a criminal justice issue, and some try to make it just a health care issue. Both approaches oversimplify this complex and heartbreaking challenge. It is imperative to reduce both the demand and supply if treatment and recovery programs are going to work. To win this fight across the country, I believe we need a multi-faceted strategy that: Prevents drug abuse and addiction before it begins: Drug abuse and addiction prevention efforts must start in childhood. That begins with dedicated parents, strong communities and local education. The private sector must also be committed to joining this fight to achieve success, including coalitions driven by local communities and involving health, local law enforcement and social services professionals. When I was governor of Florida, my wife Columba took a very active role in prevention efforts with children; treatment facilities focusing on women with children and struggling children; and coordination of a resource network for local communities at the county level. Strengthens criminal justice: I will ensure federal law enforcement agencies have the resources they need, support policies that distinguish pill mills from evidence-based pain clinics, and broaden access to drug courts, an alternative to the traditional punishment system so that nonviolent drug offenders obtain treatment and recovery support. I will also enact smarter sentencing laws for drug offenders, with stiff consequences for drug lords, cartels and violent drug traffickers, while ensuring nonviolent drug offenders obtain the necessary treatment and more quickly return to their communities with reduced mandatory sentences. Secures the border to stop the flow of illicit drugs: I will secure the border to stop the flow of illicit drugs into the United States, given that most heroin enters the United States from Mexico. I will work with partner nations, such as Mexico, Colombia and Afghanistan, to address the source of illicit drugs and interdict illicit drug trafficking. Improves drug abuse treatment and recovery programs: I will strengthen and coordinate Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) to monitor and analyze electronic prescribing and dispensing data. I will promote innovation for a suite of treatment and recovery tools that align with individuals’ unique medical needs and beliefs. And I will conduct a rigorous evaluation of existing prevention, treatment and recovery programs to ensure funding supports evidence-based programs that consistently monitor results. Drug abuse and addiction hurts Americans from all walks of life. It is a complex problem that requires a multi-disciplinary, multi-faceted solution. It will take real leadership that makes solving the problem a top priority. I’ve successfully fought this epidemic as a Governor, but more importantly, I’ve experienced it as a father. We know how to make a difference in this fight, and with the right leadership and solutions, we will.",partial
3fb9f568,"MSF report shows price of older HIV drugs decreasing, but salvage regimens are 18 times more expensive than first-line treatment Opinion: Pandemics and freedom — finding balance As a state representative, I have had a front-row seat for Missouri’s response to the coronavirus threat. We made significant preparations to cope with the influx of patients and said our prayers that social distancing and the shelter in place orders would “flatten the curve” sufficiently to save lives and save us from the worst-case scenario nightmare predictions of millions dead nationwide. It has been greatly encouraging to hear from our governor and public health officials on a daily basis that we have mobilized vast resources, provided millions of dollars for equipment that our health care providers and first responders need to keep them safe while they tend to our sick, cut through red tape to make sure that intended recipients get what they should in record time, made sure that our food supply is safe, and have taken common-sense precautions to keep the “curve” as flat as a molehill when compared to the mountains experienced in other countries. Thankfully, we have seen success to date, as nearly half of our counties have not reported positive cases. It is also gratifying to see the private and nonprofit sectors do what they always do — help in as many ways as possible as quickly as possible to help those in need, starting with distributing food and assisting businesses with the application process to access government resources without further delay. The U.S. has never shut its economy down before on such a scale on purpose. We are in uncharted waters, and it has been gratifying to see how many Americans have risen to the challenge selflessly, starting with our health care workers and first responders, our schools, and our businesses that are enduring hardships unimaginable six months ago. On the other hand, I have seen the worst, starting with the morons in neighboring states who stockpiled hand sanitizers to sell at radically marked up prices online, raids on toilet paper based on some manner of wisdom that has so far escaped me, and the most galling of all, panic selling by allegedly intelligent financial wizards who manage to detonate trillions of dollars in market value on a daily basis because their quarterly numbers are not going so well — despite the undisputed knowledge that “this too shall pass.” If this lunacy continues, our retirement accounts will need another 10 years of contributions before we can comfortably leave the workforce. I have also spent more time than I would like knocking down nasty rumors that would only make a bad situation worse and plowing through red tape and Catch-22s that have still managed to survive. Another troubling development: We have been inundated with breathless, non-stop reporting about the numbers who have contracted the virus and those who have died here and worldwide, dutifully updated faster than the financial news updates stock prices. On the other side of that equation, context is sorely lacking: Nowhere near equal time has been given to the stories of those who have contracted the virus and lived through it, which is in fact the vast majority of those who have been sickened. We have had celebrities sickened by the virus — Tom Hanks and Boris Johnson come to mind immediately. Both survived and are on the mend. The folks in the mass media have been inexplicably restrained about dispensing hope by sharing the good news that the U.S. has a remarkably low death rate per thousand of confirmed cases — which is even less than advertised since there are probably millions among us who have had the virus, thought it was something else, and came through unharmed. I will not hold my breath that the mass media will change its tactics any time soon. As a state representative, I also have to think ahead to the lessons to be learned from this pandemic and how to best apply them at both the policy and appropriations levels. These are a few of the items I am contemplating at the moment. First, how do we — if possible — stop or severely curtail the damage to our people physically and economically as a result of viruses that sweep the globe with alarming regularity? Since China appears to be the world’s leading petri dish for brewing viruses that kill animals as well as humans and reportedly facilitates the jump of viruses from animals to humans through the ingestion of such critters as bats and pangolins available through so-called “wet markets,” do we need to permanently medically screen all travelers from China before we allow them to disembark from planes or ships when we know that this virus has as long as a two-week fuse? We wait in long lines at airports now for the TSA to make sure that all of us are not terrorists. The coronavirus has killed a lot more people than terrorists and shaved trillions off our economy, damage that terrorists can only dream of. For added context, anyone who believes that China is our “friend” has ignored that it is a totalitarian state that has lied through its collectivist teeth about the origins of this virus and fanned on the opportunity to contain it locally in Wuhan, has “relocated” at least 1 million Uighurs into “re-education” camps to cure them of their religious beliefs, has engaged in industrial espionage (and outright intellectual property theft) on a scale never seen before in human history, has invested trillions in infrastructure to control the economic destiny of Asia, all while instituting a “social credit system” designed to enforce domestic “conformity” of more than 1 billion people using Orwellian facial recognition technology to do so (or else). Khruschev told the West he would “bury” us and took off his shoe and banged it on a table at the U.N. to get our attention; China’s President for Life, i.e., Dictator, Xi, has spared us the histrionics and has instead put our trade deficit money to work to bury us quietly, slowly and surely. Before the dawn of the 20th century, American policy going back to John Hay’s Open Door Notes nearly 125 years ago was predicated on the notion that Chinese consumers would purchase American products in vast quantities and make us rich as a result. The exact opposite has happened. Missouri alone now imports more than $4 billion in goods from China. That represents 20 percent of all the imports in Missouri. China, in turn, buys $700 million of our goods, for a trade deficit in Missouri alone of more than $3.2 billion. We have seen the folly of chasing after the lowest possible price over the last 30 years: The result has been the hollowing out of our manufacturing sector, which devastated the Midwest. We have plenty of empty buildings to show you in Hannibal that are monuments to short-sighted trade policies that gave away our manufacturing birthright. Our farmers are also feeling the pain of the unpredictability of Chinese markets. At least 25 percent of Chinese hogs have been killed by the latest outbreak of swine flu — probably twice that, considering that China is not renowned for telling the truth about bad news (see coronavirus bald-faced lies above). Those hogs will take years to replace; meanwhile, the soybeans they consumed as feedstocks will not be headed to China any time soon. We literally cannot afford to wait for them to repopulate their swine herds. Charity begins at home. And so does sustained prosperity. Second, the damage to our economy due to supply chain interruptions from around the globe — primarily China and Japan, but also including Europe — must be examined. Just-in-time delivery is the cornerstone of lean manufacturing, but global disruptions such as this are yet another reminder that globalization is fine and dandy when it works, but craters national economies when it does not. We reroute commerce across Missouri and the Midwest when we are confronted with floods, but this is something different altogether — global supply chains rely on products that begin their transit oceans away, not from neighboring states. The more we make in America, the less we have to rely on products coming in from overseas. And will someone explain the rationale for outsourcing so much of our prescription drug production to China? What corporate geniuses decided that would be in our best interest as a nation? What happens when that supply chain “breaks,” or China decides to sell prescription meds to others? We should be smart enough to never find out that answer, starting today. Third: When will we start treating broadband internet as infrastructure, every bit as critical to our daily lives as roads, bridges, and electricity? Millions of Americans have been instructed to work from home as a result of this pandemic, and corporations will be evaluating the effectiveness of that approach to their bottom lines. Many of us anticipate that the expedient will become the norm since remote workers cut down on overhead expenses. Working remotely is fine and good if you have the internet capability to do so, but nearly 1 million Missourians in rural areas do not. The same goes for the expanded access to telemedicine announced at the federal level — great for those who have it, irrelevant for those who do not. Imagine how many fewer cases of the flu we would deal with on an annual basis if patients could be diagnosed and treated from home and not have to share their sickness with the general public in the first place. Millions of American students are being told to log on to their portals for online instruction while their schools are closed, but that is not an option for far too many of Missouri’s rural school students — an estimated 20,000 Missouri high school seniors alone this year have no such access at the most critical moment of the year: just before graduation. Virtual education is there in statute and with us in spirit, but does not happen for students who live outside of town. Finally, we have seen multiple excesses regarding the most routine of civil rights: a governor who has forbidden planting vegetables in family gardens and a mayor taking license plate numbers at drive-in church services like the FBI at a mob boss funeral are two of the most disturbing examples. If there is a “second round” of this virus in the fall and there is no vaccine available for all of us, we are going to have to make hard choices about how far is too far. Hopefully sooner rather than later, we will take a hard look at the lessons learned from how we handled our response to the coronavirus at the beginning of the 21st century’s “Roaring Twenties.” My prayer is that we all not only survive this pandemic but also find ways to take the sting out of the next inevitable wave of sickness that will wash over our shores in the coming months and years. Knowledge without application is useless. This is the ultimate teachable moment. We literally cannot afford to ignore it.

940bb348,"The latest coronavirus threat really hits below the belt. A new study claims the coronavirus can not only rob you of your taste and smell — it may leave men infertile and could be transmitted sexually. The study, published last month in JAMA, a monthly open-access medical journal published by the American Medical Association, found the presence of COVID-19 in 15% of semen samples collected. Researcher Dr. John Aitken likened it to the Zika virus. “It should be emphasized spermatozoa have a demonstrable capacity to carry viral infections from the male to the female reproductive tract, As happens during the sexual transmission of Zika, for example,” he told local San Antonio Fox 8. Zika virus is a mostly mosquito-borne virus that can also be sexually transmitted. The study also found that COVID-19 in human sperm “leads to a build-up of angiotensin II, which is a hormone that regulates kidney function and blood pressure. Increased levels of this hormone cause an immune response against the invading COVID-19 virus particles that increases the availability of reactive oxygen species that causes cell death… Prolonged exposure to elevated angiotenstin II levels can lead to cell death in sperm.” The study notes it could “ultimately result in a loss of male fertility.” SHARE By Mary Burke's support of the proposal to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour might make for good politicking in her campaign for governor, but her plan would be economically devastating to thousands of Wisconsin workers. Raising the minimum wage is a lose-lose proposition because it will result in significant Wisconsin job losses, will reduce economic opportunity for younger and lower-skilled workers, will raise consumer prices and will not meaningfully reduce poverty or help the working poor. A recent analysis by the Employment Policies Institute (EPI) found that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would kill as many as 27,937 jobs in Wisconsin. That estimate is consistent with a projection by the Congressional Budget Office that predicted 500,000 lost jobs nationwide if the federal minimum wage was increased to $10.10. So how would raising the minimum wage result in lost jobs? The answer is quite simple. Increasing the minimum wage will increase labor costs for employers. In turn, employers will respond by reducing their workforce, hiring fewer workers and reducing hours of work for existing employees. That translates into job loss and fewer economic opportunities for workers. WMC recently commissioned a statewide poll to test this issue and found 53% of likely voters initially support increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. However, voters quickly abandon the proposal when told of the projected job losses. Support plummets to 39% when voters know raising the minimum wage kills jobs. In order to understand who will be harmed most by a minimum wage increase, it is important to understand who minimum wage earners are. The data show those who stand to lose the most from a minimum wage increase are younger and lower-skilled workers. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 1.1% of workers over age 25 earn the minimum wage. That's because typical minimum wage earners in America are teenagers living with their parents in middle-class families. They are not living in poverty nor are they earning a wage that is responsible for sustaining a family. Wisconsin is no exception. According to the EPI analysis, the average household income of Wisconsin families impacted by raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour is $58,812. That's actually higher than Wisconsin's median household income of $52,627. Clearly, the majority of minimum wage earners are not the working poor, but are instead young people entering the workforce with little experience and very few skills. They are people who desperately need entry-level jobs to begin the process of climbing the economic ladder by acquiring skills that lead to better jobs with higher wages. Unfortunately, increasing the minimum wage places the bottom rung of the economic ladder out of reach for many of these workers by eliminating entry-level positions that help workers gain the experience needed to advance in the workforce. Those who advocate a minimum wage increase as a means to reduce poverty are on the wrong side of history. Increasing the minimum wage has proven to be an ineffective policy in terms of reducing poverty. The U.S. Census Bureau recently released a report that found 59.7% of working-age people in poverty do not work. It is difficult to imagine how increasing the minimum wage will help lift people out of poverty when roughly 60% of those in poverty aren't even working in the first place. The empirical evidence also suggests raising the minimum wage simply does not impact poverty levels. Between 2003 and 2007, a total of 28 states increased their minimum wage beyond the level of the federal minimum wage. A study done in 2010 by Joseph Sabia and Richard Burkhauser focused on the minimum wage and poverty found no evidence the minimum wage lowered poverty rates in any of those 28 states. Increasing the minimum wage is a poorly conceived economic policy that would cost Wisconsin thousands of jobs. It misplaces focus on the small sliver of the workforce (2.5%) who earn the minimum wage while simultaneously making it harder for entry-level workers to get ahead. Politicians should instead focus on how we can improve our state's business climate to attract and retain high-wage jobs such as those in our manufacturing sector.

But experts who have been analysing the Sun believe there is evidence to suggest that it could last until 2055. The Sun follows 11 year cycles where it reaches a solar maximum and then a solar minimum. Are we in hot weather peak? Solar minimum could bring big freeze Space weather: NASA predicts next solar maximum will peak on THIS date During a solar maximum, the Sun gives off more heat and is littered with sunspots. Less heat in a solar minimum is due to a decrease in magnetic waves. However, there are occasions when a solar minimum or maximum can go on for more than one cycle. The most famous example of this is the Maunder minimum, which saw seven decades of freezing weather, began in 1645 and lasted through to 1715, and happened when sunspots were exceedingly rare. During this period, temperatures dropped globally by 1.3 degrees celsius leading to shorter seasons and ultimately food shortages in what was called a “mini Ice Age”.",fake

This bill, which is supported and endorsed by FAIR, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, would impose a 2% fee on all remittances headed south of the US border. Remittances, or wire transfers, are commonly used by illegal immigrants to move money from the US to their home countries. In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the US, while other South and Central American countries received over 15% of their GDPs in the form of remittances. “President Trump has made it very clear that he intends to complete a wall along our Southern border. As a senior member of the Homeland Security committee, I have long supported the border wall, which will protect Americans.” Rogers said. “In order to jumpstart the funding of the wall, I have introduced a bill to impose a 2% fee on remittances sent south of the border. This bill is simple – anyone who sends their money to countries that benefit from our porous borders and illegal immigration should be responsible for providing some of the funds needed to complete the wall. This bill keeps money in the American economy, and most importantly, it creates a funding stream to build the wall,” Rogers said. - ### -",partial

beea9b95,"Theresa May admits Government’s social security experts were not consulted about disability benefits cuts By Truth In Sentencing Project, Press Release LISTEN to the Radio Ad here Lake Oswego, Or (July 19, 2012) – The Truth in Sentencing Project, a foundation dedicated to educating and informing Oregon’s citizens about the state’s criminal justice, prison systems and sentencing laws is releasing its first ad today. The ad is intended to let Oregonians know who is in prison and why they are there. • It addresses Oregon’s low incarceration rate, 33rd out of 50 states. Nearly 2/3rds of states have higher incarceration rates. The ad also calls into question Oregon’s high cost per day to incarcerate compared to other states such as Idaho. “There’s a lot of misinformation out there about Oregon’s sentencing laws and the criminal justice and prison systems and the Truth in Sentencing Project’s goal is to dispel those misconceptions,” said Steve Doell, Executive Director. For instance, many people believe that up to fifty percent of the prison population is incarcerated for possessing drugs. • In some states that may be true, however in Oregon less than one-half of one percent of Oregon’s 14,000 inmates is serving time for drug possession, and those were convicted for possession of substantial quantities of illegal drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine, according to the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission (CJC). Also according to the CJC: • Less than 1 in 4 of all convicted felons receive prison sentences in Oregon. • About 7 in 10 of Oregon’s inmates are in prison for violent crimes and serious sex offenses including felony assault, armed robbery, kidnapping, manslaughter, child molestation, rape, attempted murder, and murder. • Seventeen percent are repeat property criminals, burglary, identity theft, fraud and car theft. Most of the rest are repeat drug criminals, almost all convicted of manufacturing and/or dealing substantial quantities of illegal drugs. One of the main reasons for the high percentage of violent criminals in Oregon prisons is because the voters passed Measure 11 in 1994. “The voters were tired of the high violent crime rate in Oregon and violent criminals receiving short sentences so they put a high priority on violent crimes,” Doell stated. “And while Oregon’s violent crime rate increased nearly 700% from 1960 until 1985, then basically plateaued through 1995, the violent crime rate has decreased more than 50% since then. We believe one of the most significant reasons for this decrease is Measure 11,” Doell added.",truth
59c7030a,"The Prices Of Food Items Are Coming Down – Garba Shehu A Catholic school in Kentucky has condemned a group of its students after they were recorded harassing a Native American Vietnam veteran in a video that went viral on Saturday. The students, many of whom were wearing “Make America Great Again” caps, from private, all-male Covington Catholic High School in Park Hillswere in Washington for an anti-abortion rally on Friday when they were filmed surrounding Nathan Phillips and mocking the Native American’s singing and drumming. One teen in particular is seen standing in front of Phillips, staring into his face with a smile. Fellow students, many in hats and sweatshirts with President Donald Trump’s “MAGA” slogan, cheered him on and chanted, “build the wall, build the wall”, Phillips said. The footage was shared online by organizers of an indigenous peoples’ march that also took place on Friday. The video prompted a torrent of outrage online. Actress and activist Alyssa Milano tweeted that the footage “brought me to tears”, while actor Chris Evans tweeted that the students’ actions were “appalling” and “shameful”. In a joint statement, the high school and Diocese of Covington condemned the actions of the students “towards Nathan Phillips specifically, and Native Americans in general”. “We extend our deepest apologies to Mr. Phillips,” the statement read. “This behavior is opposed to the Church’s teachings on the dignity and respect of the human person.” “The matter is being investigated and we will take appropriate action, up to and including expulsion.” Covington Mayor Joe Meyer, a Democrat, said the “appalling” footage had rightly inspired “a tidal wave of condemnation” and that his town was now being linked with “intolerance and ethnic intimidation” because of the boys’ actions. “The videos being shared across the nation do NOT represent the core beliefs and values of this city,” he said in a statement. In a separate video uploaded to social media, the 64-year-old Phillips, an elder of Nebraska’s Omaha tribe, wiped away tears as he described the incident. “I heard them saying ‘build that wall, build that wall’. These are indigenous lands, we’re not supposed to have walls,” he said. “I wish I could see that energy of that young mass of young men, put that energy into making this country, really, really great, helping those that are hungry.” He told The Washington Post that while he was drumming, he thought about his wife, Shoshana, who died of bone marrow cancer nearly four years ago, and the threats that indigenous communities around the world are facing. “I felt like the spirit was talking through me,” Phillips said. Phillips holds an annual ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery to honor Native American veterans, according to media reports. He is a well-known Native American activist who was among those leading the Standing Rock protests in 2016-2017 against the construction of an oil pipeline in North Dakota. Democratic US Congresswoman Deb Haaland, a member of New Mexico’s Laguna Pueblo tribe, said on Twitter that Phillips had risked his life for his country, and that the students showed “blatant hate, disrespect, and intolerance”.

353ed1f7,"Muslim women most disadvantaged, say MPs The New York Times had no idea in 1984 that a piece taking a deep dive into the life of an upcoming billionaire would eventually resurface as confirmation of just how PERFECT a fit President Trump is for this time in America. We pulled out the highlights for you below but the entire article is incredible. Who could have predicted in 1984? Well, it seems that The New York Times described brilliant businessman Donald J. Trump as a great future President of the United States… THE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP: ‘DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!’ The men were yelling, eager to call him by name. A storm front of cigar smoke was gathering above the hotel ballroom, packed elbow-to-elbow for a breakfast-hour sports forum with a crowd that included some of New York’s most wealthy, powerful and famous men. He has no public-relations agent. His competitors wonder how this can be, but watching him at the sports forum provided an explanation. While executives of the other teams told the audience about problems of negotiation and arbitration, about dirty restrooms inside their arenas and street crime outside and about ‘attempting to move the Mets in the right direction,’ “He said further that he would ‘continue to create chaos’ for the N.F.L. and, by the way, that he planned to build a domed stadium in New York.” Donald Trump was electrifying the room the rat-a-tat-tat revelations, dropping names of star N.F.L. players and coaches he would sign in a matter of hours. IT IS NOT YET 9 AM SPENDING A DAY WITH Donald Trump is like driving a Ferrari without the windshield. It’s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth. Although he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world’s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate. He has told people in the communications industry that he is ‘very interested in communications,’ which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous. The Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him ‘a real-estate genius’ who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970’s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that. Many urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. ‘With manufacturing leaving,’ says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, ‘and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.’ The rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated. That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump’s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code. ‘He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,’ a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project. The day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer. For a billion-dollar corporation, there aren’t too many people around. Donald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions. He does not seem to write anything down, keeping volumes of company files as mental notes. Says Louise M. Sunshine, executive vice president: ‘If it is not the impossible, Donald is simply not interested. There has to be creativity. Money ceased to be the object a long time ago.’ Mr. Trump agrees with this assessment. ‘He is an almost unbelievable negotiator,’ says Irving Fischer of HRH Construction. ‘I don’t worship at the shrine of Donald Trump,’ he says, ‘but our company has given up trying to negotiate costs with him. We just say: ‘Tell us what you want, you’re going to get it anyway.’ ‘Trump can sense when people might want to get out of a project,’ says a developer… He trusts his instincts and has the guts to act on them.’ Roy M. Cohn, Mr. Trump’s friend and attorney, adds: ‘He has an uncanny sense of knowing that something is a good deal when it looks dismal to everyone else.’ Such was his first deal in Manhattan, his purchase of the Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street in the mid-1970’s, when even the Chrysler Building across the street was in foreclosure. Fred Trump described his son’s efforts to buy the hotel as ‘fighting for a seat on the Titanic.’ But, Donald Trump says, ‘I saw all those people coming out of Grand Central Terminal, and I said to myself, ‘How bad can this be?” He completely renovated the hotel, reopening it as the chrome-and-glass Grand Hyatt Hotel. He had moved in quietly, sending 14 different people to purchase 15 parcels of land and keeping his name out of it. ‘If the seller was Italian,’ says Mr. Trump, ‘we sent an Italian’ – something he probably did not learn at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, where he received a B.A. in economics in 1968. He bought and sold a few pieces of real estate in Philadelphia when he was bored with classes. ‘It’s in his genes,’ says Fred Trump, explaining his son’s success in real estate and recalling his three sons growing up on construction sites and in rental offices. ‘Donald Trump is the Michael Jackson of real estate,’ says Mr. Fischer. ‘We’ve been dealing with him since he was 16. He was an old trouper at age 25.’ His success also derives from his marketing skills. ‘I want to bring a little showmanship to real estate,’ Mr. Trumps says. He is often compared to the late William Zeckendorf, the renowned New York builder, who was said to owe much of his success to his personal flair. Other New York developers – including the Lefraks, the Rudins, the Tishmans, the Fishers, the Roses – go quietly about building more buildings than does Donal Trump, making their millions and keeping their names out of things. Some developers find Mr. Trump’s high-profile approach disagreeable, but most concede that it has worked for him. Preston Robert Tisch, a developer and chief operating officer of the Loews Corporation, who lost out to Mr. Trump in the battle over whose site would be chosen for the city’s convention center, concludes: ‘He captured the imagination of people to a greater degree than I could.’ The condominiums in Trump Tower are selling rapidly at what many believe are exorbitant prices, while less costly units in Museum Tower, for example, another ‘super luxury’ building a few blocks away, are not. According to a marketing study of four such buildings made by the rudential Insurance Company of America, Donald Trump seems to be the only person in New York who knows how to market superluxury apartments. How do you sell a one-bedroom apartment costin as much as a line item in the Department of Defense budget? ‘You sell them a fantasy,’ Mr. Trump explains. ‘He deserves full credit for his success,’ says another builder. ‘He spent $1 million on the waterfall in Trump Tower. No one else would have done that. If the building fails everyone will say: ‘Well sure, what jackass spends a million bucks on a waterfall?” ‘What sets Trump apart,’ says Ben V. Lambert, a real-estate investment banker, ‘is his ability to pierce through the canvas and get things done.He gets projects literally off the ground while others are having meetings and doing feasibility studies. But his real skill is putting together complex pieces of the puzzles: fiancing, zoning, parcels of land and such. This ethereal part of building is perhaps more important than the brick and mortar.’ ‘You don’t use the term ‘settlement’ with Donald.’ Mr. Trump does not place patience on his list of virtues. Workmen confirm a story that he paid $75,000 to truck several 40-foot trees from Florida to Trump Tower, where a tunnel was built into the building so the trees would not be damaged by frost. The 3,000-pound trees were then installed in the lower plaza of the atrium. Mr. Trump did not like the look. He ordered the trees removed, and, when workmen balked for 24 hours, Mr. Trump had the trees cut down with a chainsaw. He speaks slowly and softly and in the same casual manner to eminent architects an business moguls as to the coffee and sandwich vendor outside his casino-hotel. He is said, by acquaintances, to be generally even tempered and rarely seems ruffled. He is not given to unkind remarks and is nearly always in a positive frame of mind. I never think of the negative, he says. All obstacles can be overcome. He talks boastfully about his projects, but is uncomfortable talking about himself. He does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. He plays golf and tennis regularly. His wife describes him as an all-American boy who likes country music best and prefers a steak and baked potato to anything called cuisine. His father pulled Donald Trump out of a prep school because he didn’t want his son growing up with spoiled kids with $40 ball gloves, sending him instead to military school. His father bragged at the sports forum that he had taken the subway and saved $15 car fare. Mr. Trump seems to have maintained a detached view of his flood of fortune and publicity. He frequently mentions that all of the attention and success may well be fleeting. His friends say that he is not yet fully cognizant of his station. He loves to got to ’21’ for lunch and be impressed with all the wealthy, powerful, famous people, says an acquaintance. He doesn’t quite realize that he’s one of them. After dusk, he rides through the city on his way to the last appointment of the day, enjoying the lights that make the whole city sparkle like the inside of Trump Tower. He talked about his plans for the future, as much as anyone who operates on spontaneous combustion can. Asked to explain, he adds: What does it all mean when some wacko over in Syria can end the world with nuclear weapons? He says that his concern for nuclear holocaust is not one that popped into his mind during any recent made-of-television movie. He says that it has been troubling him since his uncle, a nuclear physicist, began talking to him about it 15 years ago. His greatest dream is to personally do something about the problem and, characteristically, Donald Trump thinks he has an answer to nuclear armament: Let him negotiate arms agreements – he who can talk people into selling $100 million properties to him for $13 million. Negotiations is an art, he says and I have a gift for it. The idea that he would ever be allowed to got into a room alone and negotiate for the United States, let alone be successful in disarming the world, seems the naive musing of an optimistic, deluded young man who has never lost at anything he has tried. But he believes that through years of making his views known and through supporting candidaes who share his views, it could someday happen. He is constantly asked about his interest in running for elective office. Absolutely not, he answers. All of the false smiles and the red tape. It is too difficult to really do anything. He dislikes meetings and paperwork and is in the enviable position of being able to avoid both. AREN’T WE LUCKY THAT THIS BRILLIANT MAN IS OUR PRESIDENT! source:https://100percentfedup.com",fake
16ce44aa,"These gender-neutral schools want to crush stereotypes Republican State Senator and candidate for governor, Michael Williams, announced his opposition to regulating or banning bump stocks. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms determined in a 2015 memo that bump stocks are not mechanical, therefore they do not fall under the machine gun weapons ban of 1986. An attack on bump stocks is an attack on the Second Amendment. In solidarity with gun owners across the nation, Michael Williams is giving away a free bump stock to one lucky winner. Williams said, “The tragedy in Las Vegas broke my heart, but any talk of banning or regulating bump stocks is merely cheap political lip service from career politicians. In reality, the bump stock is the new, shiny object politicians are using to deceive voters into believing they are taking action against gun violence. Many firearms experts determined the Las Vegas shooter’s use of a bump stock actually prevented more casualties and injures due to its inconsistency, inaccuracy, and lack of control. There is zero evidence that banning bump stocks would prevent any gun violence deaths. Georgia’s gun owners deserve a governor who will stand with them when liberals and Hollywood elites attack our fundamental rights. That’s why I am standing for the second amendment and giving away a bump stock as a show of support.” “If politicians wanted to have a real conversation on reducing gun violence, they would be discussing mental health awareness, and ways to reduce the weekly bloodbath in Chicago and other inner cities. You cannot regulate evil out of existence. Blaming guns or bump stocks for the actions of a lunatic, is the same as blaming McDonald’s for heart disease,” continued Williams. “I will stand up for the Second Amendment against liberals and weak Republicans who wish to limit our freedoms. Not only that, I will continue to call out Democrats and Republicans who provide cheap talk and excuses rather than solutions.” ### BUMP STOCK GIVEAWAY LINK https://williamsgeorgia.com/bump-stock-giveaway/",fake
6bb4fea4,"USCIS Announces Final Rule Enforcing Long-Standing Public Charge Inadmissibility Law Thank you to Universities UK UUK for hosting us today. In my first speech on universities a month ago, I addressed the subject of international education. I am proud of the sector’s international standing and reputation around the world. Today, I want to reflect further on what underpins this excellence, and what more we can do to enhance it. At the root of that success is the autonomy and academic freedom that enables us to attract brilliant people to work in and run our universities and lead our sectoral bodies. I’d like to congratulate Nicola Dandridge for her recent CBE and thank outgoing UUK President, Chris Snowden, for his excellent service. I would also like to congratulate Dame Julia Goodfellow on taking over the UUK Presidency – the first woman to hold the post ever, I believe in around 100 years of the existence of UUK and its predecessor body. Success of the sector The higher education sector can be proud of its success over the last 5 years and I want to pay tribute to my colleagues David Willetts and Greg Clark for their part in the reforms that have helped sustain the high esteem in which it is held around the world. We have seen: a transformed financial situation; as the OECD says, we are one of the only countries in the world to have found a way of sustainably funding higher education we have seen record numbers of young people entering higher education, including record numbers from disadvantaged backgrounds and we have seen record numbers of graduates in work; the recent Graduate Labour Market statistics showed the highest employment rate for working age graduates since 2007 at 87.5% through all this, the UK has retained its place as a world leader in HE , with 4 universities in the global top 10, and as number one in the world for the impact of our research Unfinished business It’s a great success story, but there is unfinished business and, in the coming months, my focus will be on implementing 3 key manifesto pledges, so that we consolidate and build on these achievements: firstly, lifting the cap on student numbers and widening participation, so that we remove barriers to ambition and meet the PM’s commitment to double the proportion of disadvantaged young people entering higher education by 2020 from 2009 levels secondly, delivering a teaching excellence framework that creates incentives for universities to devote as much attention to the quality of teaching as fee-paying students and prospective employers have a right to expect thirdly, driving value for money both for students investing in their education, and taxpayers underwriting the system, so that we ensure the continuing success and stability of these reforms Taking these points in reverse order. Meeting value for money expectations Around now, the first cohort of students to enter under the 2012 reforms is preparing to enter the labour market. They have been working hard for their final exams and made a significant investment in higher education. They are looking critically at what they get for that investment, and so must we, as a government, on behalf of taxpayers. I am concerned that recent surveys – the HEPI-HEA Student Academic Experience Survey, as well as a BBC/ComRes poll – showed that only around half of students felt their course had provided good value for money. All of us need to reflect on this and on what we can do to address such unease. More informed choices Thanks to the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act passed in March, we can now start to assess the employment and earnings returns to education by matching Department for Business, Innovation and Skills BIS and Department for Education DfE education data with HMRC employment and income data and Department for Work and Pensions DWP benefits data. Information of this sort will be incredibly useful for young people choosing courses or jobs that are most suitable for them. It will also enable education providers to assess their effectiveness in delivering positive labour market outcomes for their students. I am also pleased to see the piloting of new National Student Survey questions that measure the engagement of students with their course, staff and fellow students. This was shown in the US to be a good proxy for the value add of a university in terms of ‘learning gain’ - the improvement in knowledge, skills and work-readiness that students demonstrate over time. While independent learning is vital, universities must get used to providing clearer information about how many hours students will spend in lectures, seminars and tutorials, and who will deliver the teaching. Indeed the Competition and Markets Authority have advised higher education providers that information should be available to prospective students to meet the requirements of consumer law. I know this is already on the sector’s agenda. I will continue to push for more data to be made available, including for alternative providers. A Higher Education Policy Institute Hepi survey suggests as many as three-quarters of undergraduates want more information about where their fees go – and I sympathise with that. Such transparency looks to me like an essential way of addressing value for money concerns. More competition More competition will also be central to our efforts to drive up standards. In the last 3 years, we have seen more universities created than at any time since the 1992 expansion. We are committed to promoting high quality market entry, whilst at the same time ensuring a regulatory regime which guards against poor quality provision. More competition and more informed choice will help drive up value for money for both students and taxpayers. Graduate premium The graduate earnings premium is an important measure of the value universities add and of the greater productivity of those with skills acquired in higher education. Of course, many graduates will consciously choose to go into occupations that do not maximise their incomes – we must remember that education is about more than just wage returns. Indeed, that is the reason we have a progressive repayment system for student loans. But it is also important to remember that higher lifetime graduate earnings provide benefits to society – including higher tax revenues and faster and fuller repayment of student loans. Evidence of a decline in the graduate earnings premium is therefore a concern as we look to drive up productivity in the economy, secure our public finances and ensure our higher education system continues to be funded in a sustainable way. Between 2006 and 2015, the graduate earnings premium decreased from around 55% higher to around 45% higher than the earnings of non-graduates, with graduates now earning on average £31k and non-graduates £22,000. There is still a considerable benefit – but we cannot be complacent and must analyse why the premium employers pay for graduates is falling at a time when graduate-level skills are in growing demand. Course choice and curriculum design An important part of the answer is that we are not yet rising to the challenge of ensuring that enough young people are choosing courses where there are skills shortages and strong employer demand – notably in science, technology, engineering and mathematics STEM . Nor are we doing enough to ensure that all students emerge from university prepared for work. Last year’s CBI /Pearson Education and Skills survey suggested that 47% of employers felt universities should do more to help students become job-ready. Government, business and the university sector need to come together to address this mismatch between supply and demand in the graduate labour market. Businesses should not just be seen as customers of universities, recruiting the graduates they educate or buying research expertise, but as active partners. Universities need to develop business-outreach into a core function that has influence over curriculum design. Closer partnership between universities and business will help us tackle the misguided view that ‘more means worse’ and ensure that the investment both students and taxpayers make in higher education provides visible returns. Teaching Excellence Framework TEF Above all, to meet students’ high expectations of their university years and to deliver the skills our economy needs, we need a renewed focus on teaching. This is vital unfinished business from the reforms of the last Parliament. As David Willetts himself acknowledged in a recent interview with the Times Higher Education; “teaching has been by far the weakest aspect of English higher education”. This must change. There must be recognition of excellent teaching – and clear incentives to make ‘good’ teaching even better. Some rebalancing of the pull between teaching and research is undoubtedly required. It is striking that while we have a set of measures to reward high quality research, backed by substantial funding the Research Excellence Framework, there is nothing equivalent to drive up standards in teaching. That is why my priority as Universities Minister will be to make sure students get the teaching they deserve and employers get graduates with the skills they need by introducing the Teaching Excellence Framework we promised in our manifesto. Aims for the TEF My aims for the TEF are: to ensure all students receive an excellent teaching experience that encourages original thinking, drives up engagement and prepares them for the world of work to build a culture where teaching has equal status with research, with great teachers enjoying the same professional recognition and opportunities for career and pay progression as great researchers to stimulate a diverse HE market and provide students with the information they need to judge teaching quality – in the same way they can already compare a faculty’s research rating market and provide students with the information they need to judge teaching quality – in the same way they can already compare a faculty’s research rating to recognise those institutions that do the most to welcome students from a range of backgrounds and support their retention and progression to further study or a graduate job I expect the TEF to include a clear set of outcome-focused criteria and metrics. This should be underpinned by an external assessment process undertaken by an independent quality body from within the existing landscape. Believe me, I have no intention of replicating the individual and institutional burdens of the REF . I am clear that any external review must be proportionate and light touch, not big, bossy and bureaucratic. I want to work with you all, as well as with the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Quality Assurance Agency, to design a framework that has widespread support and works for the sector, as well as students and employers and taxpayers. This is not happening in isolation. It goes with the grain of our reforms since 2010 and aims to accelerate positive changes already underway in the sector. We will be consulting widely and I am not pre-empting what any of the incentives might look like. I am keen to hear your views ahead of a green paper, which the Department of Business, Innovation and SkiIls plans to publish in the autumn. Maintaining the value of our degrees One of the things I want to focus on in the green paper is how the TEF can help improve the information that matters most for graduates and employers: the degree classification. Here we face a significant challenge. The UK’s standard model of classes of honours is on its own no longer capable of providing the recognition hardworking students deserve and the information employers require. Students across the country have just finished their exams and are looking for good graduate jobs. Last week’s High Fliers survey reminded us that the class of 2015 is more career-oriented than ever before. They rightly want hard work at university to be recognised and for their degree to be a currency that carries prestige and holds its value. At the same time, businesses need a degree classification system that will help them identify the best applicants for their firms. I know the sector is starting to tackle this need for richer information through the Higher Education Achievement Report and this is a valuable development, but this work needs greater urgency. Let me explain why: There has been a significant increase in the proportion of people receiving firsts and 2:1 degrees. To the extent this expansion in the number of firsts and 2:1s is to do with rising levels of attainment and hard work, I applaud it. But I suspect I am not alone in worrying that less benign forces are at work with the potential to damage the UK higher education brand. On the face of it, the facts are certainly startling. There has been a 300% increase in the percentage of firsts since the 1990s. Over 70% of graduates now get a First or 2:1 – up by 7 percentage points in the past 5 years. And compared to just 47% in the mid-1990s. In 2013 to 14, over 50% of students were awarded an upper second, suggesting that this grade band not only disguises considerable variation in attainment, but also permits some to coast. The Higher Education Academy found that nearly half of institutions had changed their degree algorithms to; “ensure that their students were not disadvantaged compared to those in other institutions”. The Teaching Excellence Framework we will introduce will include incentives for the sector to tackle degree inflation and ensure that hard-won qualifications hold their value. I want the green paper to look at the role that external examiners play in underpinning standards and ensuring our grading system provides a clearer, more comparable picture of student attainment. Stronger student engagement I also want to make sure that the Teaching Excellence Framework encourages universities to adopt a grading system that does more to motivate and engage students throughout their course. The familiar pattern of a First, 2:1 and 2:2, Third is widely recognised. But providing extra granularity through a grade point average GPA – a 13 point scale developed by the sector – will encourage consistent effort, make it less easy to coast within the 2:1 band and give employers more information about candidates within that classification. It is vital that we continue to drive up student engagement. Students are working harder than before and that is a welcome trend, which we want to support through the Teaching Excellence Framework. But many full time students are still not being sufficiently stretched. In the most recent Student Academic Experience Survey, the total weekly workload reported by students averages 30.5 hours, including 14 hours of independent study, and varies greatly by subject. The reported weekly workload on courses such as Mass Communications and Documentation is as little as 22 hours. Students are telling us in surveys that they know they would do better by investing more time in their studies. As a more finely-calibrated long-run batting average, GPA should drive greater student engagement than our present system, which, notwithstanding more summative coursework, in many ways can still look like a snapshot performance measure. I know Sir Robert Burgess, chair of the Grade Point Average Advisory Group, has predicted all UK universities will adopt the model by the end of the decade. I support this goal and want the green paper to examine how the new Teaching Excellence Framework can encourage universities to adopt dual running of the GPA and honours degree system, as recommended in the recent Higher Education Academy report. Widening participation My focus has of course been on students and the job market. But this does not mean we overlook the value of learning for its own sake, or the role of higher education in social mobility. The 2012 reforms mean that anyone with the ability can now make going to university their goal, a fact underscored by our decision to lift the cap on student numbers altogether from this academic year. Anyone with potential to benefit from university should not be prevented from going because of their background or ability to pay. But of course there is still more to do. The Prime Minister has set an ambitious goal to double the proportion of those from disadvantaged backgrounds progressing into higher education by 2020 compared with 2009. I will challenge you to do all you can to reach this target. That’s why I am delighted that Professor Les Ebdon has agreed to extend his term as director of the Office of Fair Access to help us fulfil a commitment that is central to this One Nation Government’s aim to promote social mobility in this country. In particular, I want to see more progress being made in the most selective institutions. Data from UCAS shows the clear progress that the sector has made, and I applaud that. I want to see more outreach and more innovation in terms of course length and design. Degree Apprenticeships and 2-year courses in particular offer a more accessible route to a higher education and a faster path to productive employment. We also need to match our efforts on driving up fair access by also ensuring those young people succeed in getting a good qualification and have an opportunity to find a fulfilling career. I know that this ‘whole student lifecycle’ approach is one that you are taking seriously – and it is embedded in the National Strategy for Access and Student Success. I expect our new Teaching Excellence Framework to include incentives that reward institutions who do best at retention and progression of disadvantaged students through their college years. Conclusion I recognise that this is a challenging agenda and that you are already focused on many of these issues. We will be working with closely with universities and with the grain of reforms that have put power and choice in the hands of students. Those institutions that can demonstrate that they excel in teaching and in supporting all students – including those from disadvantaged backgrounds – through university into graduate jobs will reap rewards. If we can get this right – on driving value for money for students and taxpayers on creating incentives to encourage excellent teaching and on widening participation – then I’m confident we can together make a world-leading higher education sector greater still.",truth

GEORGIA BECOMES FIRST STATE TO BAN MUSLIM CULTURE IN HISTORIC MOVE TO RESTORE WESTERN VALUES!!! When Donald Trump proposed in 2015 that we place a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, it was at a time when Europe was experiencing historical levels of migrations and terrorism. ISIS was carrying out terrorist attacks weekly and hundreds of innocent people were getting killed. Whether it was a jihadi running over 85 people with a truck, the Paris bombings, or even the German priest that was beheaded for being a Christian–they all were fueled by Islam. People need to understand that Islam is very dangerous and contradicts everything we believe in the United States. A Georgia state legislator has introduced legislation that would ban burqas and traditional Muslim veils. State Rep. Jason Spencer (R) filed legislation on Wednesday that would prevent women from posing for driver’s license photos while wearing a veil. The measure also adds burqas to a law that makes it a misdemeanor to wear a face covering in public or while driving. Spencer argues that this bill is specifically intended to reduce fear about Islamic terrorism. Spencer’s bill would prevent women from wearing head coverings while driving or while walking down a public sidewalk. “This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us,” Spencer told WSB-TV in Atlanta. Many people will immediately read this and argue that the First Amendment allows for protection of religious freedoms, and that is a true and correct argument. Our Constitution does allow all citizens to practice whatever religion they choose. Here is the problem: Islam is not a religion. It is a cancerous disease that calls for all Christians, women, and homosexuals to be brutally murdered for the false god Allah. A vast majority of terrorist attacks are carried out in the name of Allah. When was the last time we experienced a terrorist attack from someone citing the Bible? Quran 8:12: I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them. Quran 9:29: Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. Quran 3:151: Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority. Is that what we want to blossom in our country, schools, and communities? Just for starters, Liberals already banned school prayer because Christian values may offend someone–so how is this any different? There is a difference between a hijab and burqa. Spencer is arguing that we should ban the full-on cover that cloaks women from head to toe. While Liberals will decry this action, they better accept it because it will have a snowball effect in the United States. Outside of Georgia, several other states are starting to propose similar legislation. The threat of Islam and those that practice it are so severe that France and Belgium have banned burqas and similar coverings altogether to try and keep citizens safe. Local governments in Italy, Spain, and Switzerland have also instituted bans. This move is about keeping the American people safe. Under President Trump, we will do whatever is necessary to keep the American people safe. Source: www.dailyusaupdate.com",fake

0765375b,"Joe Biden Tells Voters He’s ‘Going To Beat Joe Biden” (Natural News) For more than 60 years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has known that the changes occurring to planetary weather patterns are completely natural and normal. But the space agency, for whatever reason, has chosen to let the man-made global warming hoax persist and spread, to the detriment of human freedom. It was the year 1958, to be precise, when NASA first observed that changes in the solar orbit of the earth, along with alterations to the earth’s axial tilt, are both responsible for what climate scientists today have dubbed as “warming” (or “cooling,” depending on their agenda). In no way, shape, or form are humans warming or cooling the planet by driving SUVs or eating beef, in other words. But NASA has thus far failed to set the record straight, and has instead chosen to sit silently back and watch as liberals freak out about the world supposedly ending in 12 years because of too much livestock, or too many plastic straws. In the year 2000, NASA did publish information on its Earth Observatory website about the Milankovitch Climate Theory, revealing that the planet is, in fact, changing due to extraneous factors that have absolutely nothing to do with human activity. But, again, this information has yet to go mainstream, some 19 years later, which is why deranged, climate-obsessed leftists have now begun to claim that we really only have 18 months left before the planet dies from an excess of carbon dioxide (CO2). The truth, however, is much more along the lines of what Serbian astrophysicist Milutin Milankovitch, after whom the Milankovitch Climate Theory is named, proposed about how the seasonal and latitudinal variations of solar radiation that hit the earth in different ways, and at different times, have the greatest impact on earth’s changing climate patterns. The below two images (by Robert Simmon, NASA GSFC) help to illustrate this, with the first showing earth at a nearly zero orbit, and the second showing earth at a 0.07 orbit. This orbital change is depicted by the eccentric, oval shape in the second image, which has been intentionally exaggerated for the purpose of showing the massive change in distance that occurs between the earth and the sun, depending on whether it is at perihelion or aphelion. “Even the maximum eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit – 0.07 – it would be impossible to show at the resolution of a web page,” notes the Hal Turner Radio Show. “Even so, at the current eccentricity of .017, the Earth is 5 million kilometers closer to Sun at perihelion than at aphelion.” For more related news about climate change and global warming from an independent, non-establishment perspective, be sure to check out ClimateScienceNews.com. The biggest factor affecting earth’s climate is the SUN As for earth’s obliquity, or its change in axial tilt, the below two images (Robert Simmon, NASA GSFC) show the degree to which the earth can shift on both its axis and its rotational orientation. At the higher tilts, earth’s seasons become much more extreme, while at lower tilts they become much more mild. A similar situation exists for earth’s rotational axis, which depending on which hemisphere is pointed at the sun during perihelion, can greatly impact the seasonal extremes between the two hemispheres. Based on these different variables, Milankovitch was able to come up with a comprehensive mathematical model that is able to compute surface temperatures on earth going way back in time, and the conclusion is simple: Earth’s climate has always been changing, and is in a constant state of flux due to no fault of our own as human beings. When Milankovitch first put forward his model, it went ignored for nearly half a century. Then, in 1976, a study published in the journal Science confirmed that Milankovitch’s theory is, in fact, accurate, and that it does correspond to various periods of climate change that have occurred throughout history. In 1982, six years after this study was published, the National Research Council of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences adopted Milankovitch’s theory as truth, declaring that: “… orbital variations remain the most thoroughly examined mechanism of climatic change on time scales of tens of thousands of years and are by far the clearest case of a direct effect of changing insolation on the lower atmosphere of Earth.” If we had to sum the whole thing up in one simple phrase, it would be this: The biggest factor influencing weather and climate patterns on earth is the sun, period. Depending on the earth’s position to the sun at any given time, climate conditions are going to vary dramatically, and even create drastic abnormalities that defy everything that humans thought they knew about how the earth worked. But rather than embrace this truth, today’s climate “scientists,” joined by leftist politicians and a complicit mainstream media, insist that not using reusable grocery bags at the supermarket and not having an electric vehicle are destroying the planet so quickly that we absolutely must implement global climate taxes as the solution. “The climate change debate is not about science. It is an effort to impose political and economic controls on the population by the elite,” wrote one commenter at the Hal Turner Radio Show. “And it’s another way to divide the population against itself, with some who believe in man-made global warming and some who don’t, i.e. divide and conquer.” You can read the full Hal Turner Radio Show report at this link.

His team created the first major county online property tax payment system and the first county tax office website with online vehicle registration in Texas. (His motto was “Get on-line, not in-line.”) He was well-known as the “Tax Man” for his outspoken efforts to cut property taxes. In the most recent Legislative Session, Senator Bettencourt successfully passed Senate Bill 2, the Texas Property Tax Reform and Transparency Act of 2019, by a vote of 21-9 to bring meaningful property tax reform and relief to all Texas taxpayers. This was the first major property tax reform legislation in almost 40 years, and the culmination of two decades of advocacy. He also continued his work on adult stem cell therapies in Texas by sponsoring HB 3148, building upon previous legislative sessions to get government out of the way, allowing new therapies to flourish and give terminally and chronically ill patients hope for a better quality of life. His work during the 86th Session earned him the distinction of Senate MVP by Capitol Inside, Bull of the Brazos by Texas Monthly, the Legislative Legacy Award by Texas Public Policy Foundation and he was given the Citizen's Choice Award by Empower Texans. A champion for conservative solutions to Texas' challenges, Senator Bettencourt has built a strong reputation at the Capitol advocating for taxpayers. In his previous legislative sessions he worked tirelessly to pass conservative budgets, enact a supermajority requirement within a taxing jurisdiction to raise taxes, (which prevented a $100,000,000 tax increase in its first year) as well as author SB 7 which sought to stamp out the growing plague of inappropriate student-educator relationships. A compassionate conservative, Senator Bettencourt has been a leader on Right to Try and adult stem cell legislation, fighting for terminally and chronically ill patients across Texas to have better access to treatments and new therapies. Legislation that he sponsored on this important issue was adopted by the American Legislative Exchange Council as a national model other states could follow. He has also greatly expanded dual credit opportunities (SB 1004) for Texas students and Joint-Authored bipartisan legislation to enhance educational opportunities for students through ISD/Charter partnerships (SB 1882). Numerous organizations have acknowledged Senator Bettencourt for his work in the Texas Senate. In his first session, Capitol Inside named him Most Valuable Freshman and Vision America named him their Outstanding Texas Legislator. He has also been named “Taxpayer Advocate of the Year” by the Americans for Prosperity, Previously as an elected official he was named a “Hero of Faith” by the Houston Area Pastors’ Council, and earned the “Pioneer Award” from the Harris County Republican Party. Senator Bettencourt is the Chair of the Senate Committee on Local Government and serves on the Senate Finance, Education, and Criminal Justice committees. He has also been named to the Redistricting Committee by Lt. Governor Patrick. He also served as the Chair of the Senate Republican Caucus from January 2016 to February 2021. A Bachelor of Science graduate of Texas A&M University in Industrial Distribution, Senator Bettencourt is the President and CEO of a tax consulting company in Houston that has grown to forty employees. He is also a radio and television personality. The Senator and his wife Susan are active members of Saint John Vianney Catholic Church, where Paul is a fourth degree Knight of Columbus. Senate District 7 is located in Harris County and includes Bunker Hill Village, Hedwig Village, parts of Houston, Hunters Creek Village, Jersey Village, Piney Point Village, Spring, and Tomball.",truth

ADVERTISEMENT A USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll released Thursday evening shows Sanders leading with 44 percent to Clinton's 43 percent. Sanders's 1-point lead falls within the poll's margin of error. California's primary is open to independent voters that give Sanders a boost; among registered Democrats, Clinton still leads Sanders by 4 points, while Sanders has 50 percent support from independents to Clinton's 34 percent. But, the poll found, Clinton has a 10-point lead among those likely to vote next week, primarily due to support from older voters. Sanders has continued to close the gap between him and Clinton and has been campaigning hard across the state. “Bernie Sanders has tapped into a wellspring of support in the Democratic primary over the last several weeks and he’s closing with a rush,” said Dan Schnur, director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, which partnered with the L.A. Times to conduct the poll. If Clinton manages to hold him off and win the primary, it would be as a result of a low turnout that tilts the electorate in her direction. Sanders has barnstormed California in recent weeks, hoping to grab a large share of the state's 475 pledged delegates up for grabs. However, if primary results are as close as recent polls indicate, Sanders and Clinton would split the 475 delegates evenly, which wouldn't give the Vermont senator much of a boost in his search for the nomination. Clinton leads Sanders in the pledged delegate count 1,769 to 1,501. When superdelegates, the unbound party leaders who vote at the July convention, are factored in, the former first lady's lead blossoms to 2,313 and puts her just 70 delegates short of the Democratic nomination, according to The Associated Press delegate tracker. Sanders has pledged to fight up until the Democratic National Convention to convince superdelegates to flip and hopes a convincing win in California will help. The Los Angeles Times poll is just the latest to show it will be a close race for the two Democratic candidates. A Field poll released Thursday morning showed Clinton leading Sanders by just 2 points, 45 percent to 43 percent, among likely Democratic primary voters. And a NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Wednesday similarly shows Clinton and Sanders within 2 points of each other: Clinton leads Sanders 49 percent to 47 percent in that poll. The LA Times poll surveyed 1,500 voters from May 19-31 and has a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points. That included 903 Democratic voters, with a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points, and 503 likely Democratic voters, with a margin of error of 5 points.",fake
fad64e2f,"USA repeats as World Cup champions, beating Netherlands 2-0 Obama administration insists there was no quid pro quo, but critics charge payment amounted to ransom. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry speaking with Iranian officials including his counterpart, Javad Zarif, after the agreement was reached in Vienna in July 2015. WASHINGTON—The Obama administration secretly organized an airlift of $400 million worth of cash to Iran that coincided with the January release of four Americans detained in Tehran, according to U.S. and European officials and congressional staff briefed on the operation afterward. Wooden pallets stacked with euros, Swiss francs and other currencies were flown into Iran on an unmarked cargo plane, according to these officials. The U.S. procured the money from the central banks of the Netherlands and Switzerland, they said. The money represented the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the Obama administration reached with Iran to resolve a decades-old dispute over a failed arms deal signed just before the 1979 fall of Iran’s last monarch, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The settlement, which resolved claims before an international tribunal in The Hague, also coincided with the formal implementation that same weekend of the landmark nuclear agreement reached between Tehran, the U.S. and other global powers the summer before. “With the nuclear deal done, prisoners released, the time was right to resolve this dispute as well,” President Barack Obama said at the White House on Jan. 17—without disclosing the $400 million cash payment.",partial
11aea5b0,"DUP man dating Poots' daughter claims his 'tea' can help in Northern Ireland's Covid battle without scientific evidence By Jim Francesconi As we pass the governance torch from the State Board of Higher Education to independent boards at the University of Oregon, Portland State University and Oregon State University, we will be navigating a future of heightened risks and rewards. The rewards lie in the private sector reinforcements that are coming to the aid of our three major research universities. The caliber of some board nominees are similar to those found at Stanford, Yale, Harvard and other prestigious private universities. Major Oregon CEOs and entrepreneurs have volunteered to use their power, influence and resources to benefit Oregon's public universities. Oregon is a small state with limited public resources, great needs and high aspirations. Although our universities have a few of the nation's best programs, we are not living up to our potential. That is what happens when state funding for becomes mired near the bottom of all states for more than 20 years. Now there is the promise to leverage private resources for this vital public purpose. But there are risks as well. We need high-quality engineering and other research programs, but we cannot afford them at every campus. Portland needs to be served, with PSU in charge, but so does every part of our state. Our small schools should be strengthened, not sacrificed. Sports are important, but not the highest priority. As vital as universities are, they are means to public ends, not ends in and of themselves. Oregon needs a vibrant, innovative economy. Our universities can create more research collaboratives such as ONAMI (Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute) and the Portland Life Sciences center, which attract world-class talent and create jobs. Next up ... the Light Metals Institute sponsored by Oregon and Washington universities and the Manufacturing 21 business coalition. Oregon's per capita income is almost 10 percent below the national average. Universities can prepare more Oregonians for well-paid jobs in health care, STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, mathematics), advanced manufacturing and professional-technical careers. And we should take advantage of the growing demographic and political strength of the Latino community by working together to provide access to college and to family-wage jobs. Above all, Oregon must demonstrate that working people and poor folks can still make it in America. Education after high school is the way, but it is out of reach for many children, especially in rural Oregon. Nearly half of Oregon's children are poor. Half of Oregon university students are on Pell Grants. The average student debt is more than $25,000. As a result, fewer Oregonians are going to college. Like many, my grandparents and parents sacrificed so that I could be the first in my family to go to college. For the first time in Oregon's history, my generation is better educated than the generation that is now college age. New university board members can raise scholarship funds so that more Oregonians can graduate from UO, PSU and OSU. But these board members should also help increase philanthropy at Southern, Western, Eastern and the Oregon Institute of Technology. All Oregonians from every part of the state should have a chance to achieve their potential and contribute to our state. Finally, we must understand that philanthropy alone cannot produce excellent universities with innovative research, quality instruction and access for all Oregonians. The Legislature has consistently balanced the budget on the backs of students, forcing tuition increases. New board members have the power to reverse this practice and to force major public investments in our universities for the good of Oregon. Let us work together to apply that power to building an affordable and accessible world-class university system. Jim Francesconi is a member of the State Board of Higher Education and lives in Northeast Portland.",partial

A major audit published today also reveals that almost half of hospitals lack senior specialists at weekends. And just two out of 165 maternity units had a consultant present round the clock, according to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Scroll down for video A major audit published today also reveals that almost half of hospitals lack senior specialists at weekends. Stock image Mothers-to-be are instead left in the hands of overstretched midwives and inexperienced and often exhausted junior doctors. Although consultants are on call from home, they can live up to 30 minutes away and staff summon them only in emergencies. More than half of births take place out of hours. And research shows that babies born then are a third more likely to die or suffer serious complications. The royal college obtained the figures from 165 NHS maternity units – 82 per cent of the total. They show that: Just over 73 per cent had no consultants on the weekday overnight shift, typically 10pm to 8am; Another 43 per cent said none were on site at weekends; 89 per cent said consultants were not present for evening shifts at weekends; Heart of England NHS trust in Birmingham and Central Manchester University were the only centres with consultants day and night, all week. Maureen Treadwell, of the Birth Trauma Association, said: ‘We are concerned at the number of hospital trusts with no consultant cover at night. ‘There are a number of rare but sudden catastrophic events in labour where a less experienced doctor may need the advice or assistance of a senior colleague. ‘These are not common events, but every year some women and babies will die as a result of substandard care, often from staff who are doing their best, but may never have dealt with such a condition.’ The figures are worrying because labours are becoming more complex due to obesity and the trend for women to have babies later in life. Experts say midwives and junior doctors are less likely to spot when things go wrong and can be reluctant to summon the help of consultants. Labour wards are also under pressure because of high birth rates fuelled by migration. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman, said it shows that the Tories can;t even deliver a five-day NHS Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘It is crucial that maternity units are sufficiently staffed to provide a high level of care to all who use them – day or night. ‘The Tories talk about a seven-day NHS but these figures show they can’t even deliver a five-day NHS.’ Elizabeth Duff of the National Childbirth Trust said: ‘Women need safe maternity services whenever they give birth. We know more needs to be done to provide the right level of staff to give support when necessary.’ The royal college issued recommendations in 2009 stating that maternity units should work toward having consultants present round the clock. This would improve the care of women and the training of junior staff, the guidelines stated. Consultants are supposed to supervise the care of all patients in maternity units and intervene if something goes wrong. A major study by Imperial College London last year found that babies delivered at the weekend were 7 per cent more likely to be stillborn. And research published by Cambridge University in 2010 found that babies born overnight or at weekends in Scottish hospitals were a third more likely to die. MY BABY WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY IF I'D HAD HER IN THE WEEK Angela Owens pictured with baby Hope believes her daughter Ella would be alive today had she given birth on a weekday Angela Owens believes her daughter Ella would be alive today had she given birth on a weekday. She was two weeks overdue when she felt severe and sudden pain on a Saturday afternoon four days before Christmas 2013. The 31-year-old went to the labour ward at Warrington Hospital, describing it as a ghost town. Midwives repeatedly told her to go home and take paracetamol – and ignored her pleas for a consultant. Eventually – after her GP brother arrived – they bleeped the consultant but by this stage it was too late. When Ella was finally delivered on 11pm on the Saturday she was stillborn. The mother, who has two other daughters with her partner Paul, said: ‘There was a general flippant attitude towards me,’ ‘You put your trust in health staff in these situations, but I had to beg them for help. ‘Hospitals seem to go into sleep mode at the weekends and for us this resulted in the ultimate tragedy. It was horrendous. I will never recover from her death.’ Ella was one of ten babies who had been stillborn or died in unexplained circumstances at Warrington Hospital in a 12-month period between 2013/14. The deaths were avoidable and blamed on staffing shortages – half occurred at weekends. Advertisement The authors said the same would be true for English hospitals. They blamed the extra risks on a lack of intervention by junior doctors. NHS figures show that doctors performed almost 40 per cent of births in 2014/15 and midwives do most of the remainder. They do not state whether the former were consultants or junior doctors. But the figure has steadily increased from 24 per cent in 1989. An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Having a baby is now safer than it has ever been and the vast majority of mothers report that they get great NHS maternity care.’ The spokesman highlighted a study last year that claimed there was no evidence to show overnight consultants made any difference to safety. But he refused to acknowledge other research showing babies born out of hours were more likely to die. Tomorrow the NHS will publish its first-ever Ofsted-style ratings for maternity care in a bid to drive up standards.",truth

A picture taken outside of Cambodia of Sam Rainsy C,L and the seven other former CNRP lawmakers convicted over the coup plot. Facebook Government officials have defended the Phnom Penh Municipal Court’s conviction of former opposition leader Sam Rainsy and eight other senior officials over a plot to topple the government amid criticism over the move. Ministry of Justice spokesman Chin Malin said yesterday that the court’s decision against former opposition leaders was made according to the law, saying the court had enough arguments to prosecute them. “More importantly, the authorities have acted in accordance with legal procedures, and the courts conducted the trial based on procedure and made decisions based on the facts and existing legal aspects,” he said. Presiding Judge Duch Sok Sarin on Monday sentenced Rainsy, who is living in exile, to 25 years in jail, while Mu Sochua and Eng Chhai Eang, both vice-presidents and former lawmakers of the ex-CNRP, were sentenced to 22 years in jail each. The judge also sentenced six other ex-CNRP lawmakers to 20 years in jail each after they were found guilty of attempting to “attack” the government. They are Rainsy’s wife Tioulong Saumura, Ou Chanrith, Ho Vann, Long Ry, Men Thavarin and Nuth Romduol. All of them are living in exile abroad. The convicts were deprived of their right to vote and the right to stand for election. Rainsy vowed to return to the Kingdom to restore democracy and human rights on November 9, 2019, but his planned return failed to materialise. However, the government accused him and his allies of planning a coup. In his statement on the conviction, Rainsy said it was simply a “political statement” born out of weakness and fear. “Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen is afraid of any risk of my returning to the Cambodian political scene. He also dreads the prospect of any free and fair election which would inevitably lead to the end of his current autocratic and anachronistic regime,” he said. Rainsy claimed Mr Hun Sen has repeatedly refused to allow him and other leading figures of the ex-CNRP to return to Cambodia, saying the sentence is simply intended to intimidate ex-CNRP supporters within the country. However, Malin said ex-CNRP leaders have never acknowledged their wrongdoing. “It is normal for them to never admit their mistakes. As a justification, the perpetrator never admits that he has committed a crime,” Malin added. In its statement, the court-dissolved CNRP described the verdict as: “Cambodia’s politicised court confirms the coup and abolition of democracy”. It said it fully denies all charges and resolutely rejects the verdict. It added that 130 members of the ex-CNRP have been kept in pre-trial detention over the past year and charged as accomplices of the nine CNRP leaders. “The international community must respond to these intolerable developments in an equally determined way,” it added. “These sentences have to be denounced, rejected and ultimately withdrawn.” The US Embassy in Phnom Penh yesterday said it was troubled by the sentences handed down against the nine Cambodian political opposition leaders, including some who are also American citizens. “These sentences are part of a series of mass trials against more than 130 political opposition supporters and civil society activists, which lack basic due process,” it said. “We urge the government of Cambodia to protect freedoms of expression and association, as enshrined in the country’s constitution, and call on authorities to take meaningful steps to reopen civic and political space in the lead up to the 2022 Commune Election and the 2023 National Election,” it added. However, Cambodian People’s Party spokesman Sok Eysan said yesterday that the conviction will result in ex-CNRP leaders no longer being able to enter and participate in the 2022 and 2023 Commune and National Elections. He said the political life of the ex-CNRP leaders has come to an end because of their bad intentions against the people and nation. “The case is a legal matter, not a political one.”",fake
80c02218,"PM May stands by Sajd Javid after business rates dossier Sajid Javid pictured was last night facing an all-out revolt over business rates  Theresa May retains 'full confidence' in Communities Secretary Sajid Javid despite him facing an all out revolt over business rates.  The embattled Cabinet minister has insisted critics of the business rate revaluation have been misled by a 'relentless campaign of distortions and half-truths'.  But Mr Javid is facing claims from Tory colleagues that he is 'spinning the numbers' and a letter sent to calm down the row played down the rises.  As the row threatened to boil over, Mrs May's official spokesman was asked if the PM continued to have full confidence in Mr Javid.  He replied: 'Yes.'  The Government insists 73 per cent of firms will have the same rates or lower bills - but this leave 510,000 companies facing higher charges.  In a letter, Mr Javid begged MPs to reassure their constituents about the changes, arguing that three quarters of businesses will see their rates frozen or cut.  But last night Mr Javid was accused of peddling misinformation of his own as a new analysis suggested the Government's figures were inaccurate. The study said the bills that firms will actually receive over the next few weeks will be 7 percentage points higher on average than ministers say.  This is because 2 per cent inflation has not been factored in and the Government has assumed that its appeals system will give 5 per cent rebates to all firms – despite challenges being harder and more costly to mount.  Ex minister Grant Shapps today accused Mr Javid of 'spinning the numbers'.  He told Sky News: 'It has been suggested by Government this is fiscally neutral but it raises £1bn.  'Better just to say that, rather than spin it out as something which actually saves businesses money when it doesn't.'  Ex-minister Grant Shapps today accused Mr Javid of 'spinning the numbers' in the row over a revaluation of business rates  Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he challenged Chancellor Philip Hammond about the disputed figures at a meeting of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee yesterday.  'I'm disappointed that it would appear that the figures we were given did not set out the actual position,' he said. 'The list sets out a best case scenario. I challenged the Chancellor on it but I received no answer.'  Mr Javid's letter – also signed by Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke – said rates would fall in 250 of the 329 local billing authority areas in England – and detailed these in a list accompanying the letter.  According to an analysis by ratings specialist Gerald Eve, rates will fall in only 135 councils – and increase in 191.  Basildon, Harrogate, Canterbury and Stafford are among 124 local authorities in line for an overall hike in business rates, as opposed to the cut promised by the Government. Basildon will see business rates rise by 0.15 per cent, instead of fall by 6.3 per cent. Harrogate will see a 2.27 per cent jump, as opposed to a 4.3 per cent cut, and Canterbury will see a 0.92 per cent hike, rather than a 4.3 per cent fall.  The Communities Secretary claims small firms have been misled by a 'relentless campaign of distortions and half-truths'  The analysis says Theresa May's Maidenhead constituency will see a 15.75 per cent increase in business rates – rather than a 8.3 per cent rise claimed in the list accompanying Mr Javid's letter.  At the same time, the fall in rates in Mr Javid's Bromsgrove constituency will only be 9.29 per cent – as opposed to the Government's figure of 15.2 per cent  Jerry Schurder, head of business rates at Gerald Eve, said last night: 'The figures provided to Tory MPs show that the Department for Communities is living in a parallel universe, one where there is no inflation and an automated appeals system that gives 5 per cent rates rebates across the board.  Theresa May, pictured yesterday on the campaign trail in the Stoke by-election, retains confidence in Sajid Javid despite the furore over business rates  'But back in the real world, the bills that will land on doormats in the next few weeks will be around 7 per cent higher than these figures suggest, while appeals will be become both more expensive and less likely to succeed as the Government seeks to disincentivise businesses from challenging their bills.'  The Department for Communities and Local Government last night rejected claims that the figures were misleading. It referred the Mail to the small print which states: 'The average change in bills is before any inflation or appeals adjustments have been made.'  Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: 'Sajid Javid complained about half truths and then he puts out this guff. These figures are pure misinformation and half truths.The Government should be ashamed of themselves. They are spinning so much on this issue they are making everyone dizzy.  'While they put our data strewn with errors, small businesses are panicking about the impact of these massive rate hikes. It is time for a U-turn. The Government need to make it soon.'  Mr Javid was also under fire from business groups, MPs and small firms, which claimed he had also omitted key information from his letter about the devastating impact rate rises will have.  The Institute of Directors described Mr Javid's failure to mention the half a million firms that will see their rates go up as 'disingenuous' and warned that 'tens of thousands' could go bust.  Stephen Herring, the IoD's head of taxation, said: 'The Government is right that many businesses will see their rate bills go down, but the issue is the sudden and dramatic increases that many high street shops and pubs are having to deal with. It is disingenuous to focus on average rate reductions and ignore the fact that many small firms are facing huge rate hikes. We could see tens of thousands of firms go bust.'  The British Retail Consortium said in a statement: 'No one is a winner from this revaluation. Business rates have increased from a third of rental value in 1990 to half today.  Amanda Wrigley and her mother Shirley outside their shop Hirst Antiques, in Notting Hill, which is facing a big hike in business rates  'This is the highest commercial property tax in the developed world.The current system is not fit for purpose in the 21st century and needs fundamental reform.'  One antiques dealer said the rates hike could be the 'final nail in the coffin' for many struggling high street retailers.  Amanda Wrigley runs Hirst Antiques in Notting Hill, London, with her mother Shirley Hirst, who founded the business 53 years ago. Miss Wrigley, 36, said her rates would double while chains faced much smaller increases.  She told the Mail: 'This is not a myth. We're not making this up. This is going to affect business across the country. A lot of us are feeling the pinch already – but this could be the final nail in the coffin.  'My mum is still working at the age of 80 and enjoys what she does. But it's a lot less fun when first our rent and then out rates go up. It makes us wonder how we're going to make it work.'  Yesterday another ratings specialist said Mr Javid had also failed to mention that thousands of firms in line for the biggest cuts to business rates will not benefit for the full reduction for years because of transitional arrangements.  Analysis from ratings specialist Daniel Watney found half of firms set for the biggest rate cuts will not receive the full reduction for three years – and one in five will not see the full benefit at all before rates are revalued again in five years.  A Government spokesman said: 'These are completely spurious claims by ratings agents with more interest in their own profits than a fair deal for businesses.  'We have been clear how our figures are calculated and what they include. In fact the revaluation of business rates means three quarters of businesses will see a fall, or no change, in their bills – 600,000 small businesses will pay no rates at all.  'Far from stopping anyone appealing their bills, or setting a margin of error, our reforms will mean businesses will no longer need to go through these scaremongering ratings agencies but instead can check, challenge and appeal their bills quickly and easily.'  Debunked: Minister's claim hikes are a myth  Analysis by Business Correspondent James Salmon  Sajid Javid has written directly to MPs to try to quell the rebellion against his business rates reforms. The Communities Secretary insisted the row was based on 'myths'. But business groups last night accused him of peddling half-truths of his own.  JAVID'S CLAIM  He says the first 'myth' about revaluation is that there will be 'across the board rate rises'.  REALITY  Nobody has been claiming that most businesses will see their business rates rise. Mr Javid points out that the revaluation will lift around 600,000 smaller firms out of paying business rates, while around 740,000 will see their rates frozen. But there is no mention of government figures showing around half a million business will see an increase in their rates of up to 300 per cent.  The minister also hails the 'unprecedented £6.7billion package of rate relief' to ensure that those facing the biggest rate hikes see them phased in gradually. But what Mr Javid omits to say is that those firms that have been lined up for cuts will not enjoy the full benefits for years. A 'downwards cap' on rate reductions means small firms can see their rates trimmed by a maximum of 20 per cent in 2017/18.  These caps are even stricter for medium and larger firms – which will receive a maximum discount of 4.1 per cent in the first year of the new regime. The reliefs are likely to come too late for the thousands of businesses already paying over the odds because the last revaluation was carried out at the height of the pre-credit crisis property boom in 2008.  According to business rates expert Daniel Watney, half of properties seeing the biggest falls in rates will not benefit from their full rates cut for three years, while one in five will not see their full rates cut before the next revaluation in five years.  CLAIM  Revaluation is 'emphatically not being used to hide a stealth rise in taxes'.  REALITY  Government figures suggest the revaluation will raise an additional £1billion in the first year alone. Business rates will raise £25.5billion in 2017-18, after the changes are introduced on April 1, up from £24.5billion this year.  Mr Javid has insisted this is simply because the number of businesses is expected to grow, with some expanding or renovating premises. This means more, and bigger businesses, will be paying into the pot.  But the British Retail Consortium and Institute of Directors both fear the reforms will drive many traders to the wall, meaning any increase in revenues to the Exchequer will have to come from firms paying more.  claim Suggestions that the rates review will devastate high streets are 'simply not true'.  Reality Again, Mr Javid appears to have deliberately misinterpreted or ignored warnings from business leaders. Lobby groups – including the Institute of Directors and the British Retail Consortium – have never suggested that hundreds of thousands of firms will go bust.  However, given that more than half a million enterprises will see their rates shoot up by up 300 per cent, the IoD believes that tens of thousands of pubs and restaurants which are already struggling, will be tipped over the edge. Retail expert Mary Portas has warned that the revaluation will 'cripple' high street shops in areas where house prices have increased.  'The tax bill which will hit retailers from April will be the single biggest blow to independent shops since the financial crisis,' she said. 'I would estimate that at least a third of them will die.'  CLAIM  The Government is 'reforming the appeals process to make it easier for business to check, challenge and appeal their bills'.  REALITY  It will become tougher and more expensive for firms to appeal, once a complaint has been rejected by the Government's Valuation Tribunal. What Mr Javid fails to mention in his letter is that the Government is introducing new charges of £150 for small firms just to appeal their rate to a tribunal. Larger companies will have to pay £300.  The Government also plans to fine businesses up to £500 if they make a 'careless' or deliberate mistake while filling out their forms. Officials claim it will deter businesses from lodging speculative appeals backed with little or no evidence. This should help to clear a backlog of 280,000 appeal cases that stretch back to 2010.  But several other changes have also been made to the appeals process that will make it harder for businesses to complain.  Previously, it was a two-stage process involving a simple form and no fees were charged. Now, it is expected to become a three-stage process, including an initial 'checking' stage where firms must confirm that every part of their property which the valuation is based on is accurate.  Experts say that businesses will also be required to submit more formal evidence than before. If the appeal has still not been resolved, the final stage is a tribunal, when a fee is charged.",partial

His predecessor as housing minister Brandon Lewis declined to bring in regulation forcing developers to fit sprinklers because he said it was not the Government's responsibility.  Jeremy Corbyn ramped up pressure by calling for Mr Barwell and others who had failed to act on calls for a safety review to face questioning.  Recommended Theresa May promises to investigate Grenfell Tower disaster  Theresa May ordered an urgent meeting of officials on Wednesday afternoon to ensure authorities were best placed to deal with the fire and its fallout, with the group concluding that checks should be carried out other blocks.  In 2013 the All-Party Parliamentary Fire Safety & Rescue Group called for a review of safety regulation, after six people died and more than 20 were hurt in the 2009 blaze at Lakanal House in Camberwell .  But the group’s honorary administrative secretary, Ronnie King, said successive ministers had failed to carry out the review that the group’s report called for.

He added: “Our group recommended that due to the speed that the fire spread in Lakanal House, that building regulations should be reviewed.  “It's nearly 11 years since it has been reviewed.”  Grenfell tower fire Show all 42 1 /42 Grenfell tower fire Grenfell tower fire Local residents watch as Grenfell Tower is engulfed by fire Getty Images Grenfell tower fire London Fire Brigade said there has been a number of fatalities from the blaze Rex Features Grenfell tower fire The fire was first reported in the early hours of Wednesday and continued into the morning Rex Features Grenfell tower fire A local resident sees the fire over the rooftops @Ebajgora Grenfell tower fire A firefighter reacts at the scene of the blaze Getty Images Grenfell tower fire Residents watch as the blaze continues Getty Images Grenfell tower fire More than 200 firefighters have been fighting the blaze PA Grenfell tower fire London Mayor Sadiq Khan has declared the fire a major incident Getty Images Grenfell tower fire Police and fire services attempted to evacuate the concrete block of flats Getty Images Grenfell tower fire A woman runs to assist paramedics working at the fire at the Grenfell Tower Getty Images Grenfell tower fire Smoke rises from the building after a huge fire engulfed the 24 story Grenfell Tower in Latimer Road, West London in the early hours of Wednesday morning Getty Images Grenfell tower fire Fire fighters tackle the 24-storey building in West London Getty Images Grenfell tower fire Ambulances are stationed nearby Getty Images Grenfell tower fire Paramedics arrive with oxygen Getty Images Grenfell tower fire Emergency services believe it will take some time to establish the cause of the fire Grenfell tower fire Tens of people have been taken to five different hospitals across London Getty Images Grenfell tower fire A man comforts a boy after the tower block was severely damaged Reuters Grenfell tower fire Firefighters stand amid debris in a childrens playground nearby Reuters Grenfell tower fire Firefighters are stationed at the building Getty Images Grenfell tower fire Smoke engulfs Grenfell tower Rex Features Grenfell tower fire Lots of people donating water, food and clothing to St Clement's church for the residents of Grenfell Tower in Latimer Road Samuel Osborne Grenfell tower fire A man speaks to a fire fighter after a huge fire engulfed the 24 story Grenfell Tower in Latimer Road, West London Getty Images Grenfell tower fire According to the London Fire Brigade LFB, 40 fire engines and 200 firefighters are working to put out the blaze.

He added: “Mr Barwell said he was still looking at it and was preparing to meet with the All-Party group. That's when the election was called and the meeting never happened.”  As the Grenfell death toll rose to 12, it also emerged that Mr Lewis, recently promoted to immigration minister, had declined in 2014 to force building developers to fit sprinklers.  The coroner's report into Lakanal House had recommended regulations be updated, and called for developers refurbishing high-rise blocks to be encouraged to install sprinkler systems.  But five years later, Mr Lewis told MPs: “We believe that it is the responsibility of the fire industry, rather than the Government, to market fire sprinkler systems effectively and to encourage their wider installation.”  He said the Tory government had committed to being the first to reduce regulations nationwide, pledging a one-in-two-out rule.  He added: “The cost of fitting a fire sprinkler system may affect house building – something we want to encourage – so we must wait to see what impact that regulation has.”  ✕ Grenfell fire update: 12 dead with death toll expected to rise  Mr Corbyn hit out at the Government’s record demanding that ministers be forced to answer questions on fire safety.  Suggesting spending cuts may also have a role to play, he said: “If you deny local authorities the funding they need, then there is a price that’s paid.”  He went on: “A review took place after the fire in Camberwell and the Government has that review.  “I believe we need to ask questions about what facilities and resources have been given to local authorities that have tower blocs in the area and, frankly, most do. We need to deal with this, we need people to be safe living in high rise buildings.”  Asked whether that involved any current serving frontbench politicians, he replied: “Obviously ministers that served and received those reports must be questioned. But today every focus and every concentration must be on saving and protecting life.”  A government spokesman said that following the Lakanal House fire, the coroner recommended the guidance relating to fire safety within the building regulations be simplified, work he said is on-going.  The coroner also asked government to write to councils encouraging them to consider retro-fitting sprinklers, he said, adding that it had happened.  The fire-damaged lower floors of the 24-storey residential Grenfell Tower block Leon Neal/Getty Images  The spokesman added: “Our thoughts are with the residents and families of everyone caught up in this dreadful event. We stand ready to help in anyway possible as the emergency services continue to stabilise the situation.  “The London Fire Brigade will be conducting their investigation and at this stage it would not be appropriate to comment on the cause of the fire.”  The cause of the fire is so far unknown, but residents had previously raised concerns that a 'catastrophic' event could happen, with an action group claiming that their warnings fell on “deaf ears”.  The group said there was one entry and exit to Grenfell Tower during improvement works at the block in Latimer Road and it had issues with evacuation procedures.  Following the fire, the group posted: “All our warnings fell on deaf ears and we predicted that a catastrophe like this was inevitable and just a matter of time.”  Grenfell was fitted with zinc rainscreen cladding and glazed curtain walling after a £10m refurbishment and some have suggested this could have exacerbated the spread of the fire, though the firm that carried out the work said it all met safety regulations.  Announcing an urgent meeting of ministers and officials in the wake of the fire, the Prime Minister said she was “deeply saddened”.  After the session finished Policing and Fire Minister Nick Hurd said they wanted to provide reassurance to people living in other buildings as soon as possible.  He said: “We have discussed with the Department for Communities and Local Government, local authorities and the fire service a process whereby we seek to identify towers that might have a similar process of refurbishment, run a system of checks so that we can, as quickly as possible, give reassurance to people.”  London Mayor Sadiq Khan said there are “questions that have to be answered” after residents of the tower were told to stay in their flats in the event of a fire.  Mr Khan condemned the “bad advice” given to residents of the west London tower block that was engulfed in flames overnight, killing several inhabitants and leaving many trapped inside the burning building.  A newsletter to residents in 2014 said the “stay put” policy worked because the block had been designed according to “rigorous fire safety standards”.",partial
c9a08752,"Budget 2015: the verdict from our columnists Tom Clark: Osborne swung his axe without mercy  Still bathing in the glow of the Conservatives’ unexpected election success, George Osborne is now determined to repeat his newly vindicated tricks during the old parliament in the new one. At the dawn of the coalition, in his first budget in June 2010, the new chancellor established one convenient untruth: that the great recession had been caused by Labour’s wild way with spending. Britain’s emergency, he said, was about state largesse “crowding out private endeavour”.  He has used the first budget of the new parliament to establish a second important untruth. Namely, that poverty in Britain is in some curious sense the product of the government having given poor people too much money. As the chancellor savaged family tax credits, he was shameless in skating over how these are in fact the building blocks for the Tories’ own universal credit, which he is undermining before it has even got going. He was shameless, too, in forgetting how he himself had – during the days when David Cameron’s Tories were still interested in projecting a moderate face – felt it necessary to increase the main tax credit rate to protect poor children. Now the credits were presented, plain and simple, as the wicked legacy of Gordon Brown, which ensnared the poor in a hideous system of bureaucracy.  Sheltering behind an eye-catching rise and rebranding of the minimum wage, which will have less effect than the headlines suggest because it is restricted to over-25s, Osborne swung his axe without mercy. Children will be cut out of the system, and therefore impoverished, simply because they have been born into bigger families. Forget the hype about a workers’ budget: low earners will be able to keep less of their pay packet before they start losing benefits. The very perversities that the universal credit pretends to solve will therefore intensify for those at the bottom of the heap. What a contrast with the position of others, higher up the pay scale, who will enjoy real income tax cuts.  Polly Toynbee: A return to public squalor and private excess  Keep your eyes on their prize – the deep and permanent shrinking of the state. Ignore the confetti of distractions – look where we are headed. The “low tax, low welfare” UK state will be smaller even than the US as a proportion of GDP by 2019 – far from the European social democratic norm.  Before these cuts, the IMF and OECD projected the UK state would fall to 36.6%, very close to the US at 35%. Germany is at 45.4%. Today’s £12bn welfare cuts add another 1.6%, so UK spending will fall below America’s.  Government is shrivelling, the welfare state dwindling. Everything that makes people proud is waning, from science to the arts, transport, libraries, sports, parks and swimming pools. It’s back to public squalor amid private excess.  Tories are liberated to reward the haves and batter the have-nothings. Hurrah for a £1m inheritance tax bonus for the richest 6% of families, despite the 100 wealthiest people owning as much as 19 million others. Cut corporation tax, while a FTSE-100 chief executive earns in three days what an average worker gets in a year.  Don’t be deceived by a minimum wage rise that doesn’t begin to compensate for drastic tax credit cuts or the £30 a week stripped from employment and support allowance. Tax cuts don’t help the 6 million too low-paid to pay tax. Housing benefit cuts will cleanse the poor from the south-east.  This was indeed an “emergency” budget for the poor, for children, for students. Osborne sneered in the Sun that he expected “depressingly predictable howls of protest”. Well, start howling now.  Matthew d’Ancona: A resounding victory for the modernising Tories    Shortly before George Osborne stood up to deliver his remarkable budget, a senior Conservative called me to say that there would be an announcement that would “round off” the long march of Tory modernisation. As it turns out, that prognosis was spot on. A process that began a decade ago with David Cameron’s recycled trainers and a photo-op with huskies ends for now in the momentous introduction of a national living wage.  There were clues, of course. Osborne is an astute political strategist who would never have hit welfare as hard as he did today without a balancing innovation to secure his party’s one-nation credentials. Taking a hatchet to tax credits, he had to offer a political quid pro quo, a measure that will start the process of making such credits unnecessary.  Why, after all, should the taxpayer subsidise the parsimony of employers? If ever there was an idea whose time has come, it is this one. Steve Hilton was often Osborne’s rival, but thanks him in the acknowledgments of his recent book, More Human. In the chapter on poverty, Hilton develops an argument for the national living wage that is to my mind unanswerable: what is the state doing he asks propping up companies that will not pay their employees a decent wage? Tories instinctively hate interventions in the labour market and warned of mass unemployment when New Labour introduced the national minimum wage. Even now, there will be Conservatives who recoil from this enlightened measure.  But the modernising wing of the party was investing ever more heavily in this particular idea. In this week’s Observer, Rohan Silva, a close friend of both Hilton and Osborne, who worked for Cameron in No 10, issued a passionate call for a compulsory living wage. This much is certain: Silva would never have sought to embarrass the chancellor on the eve of the first Conservative budget since 1996. At the very least, his article indicated the direction of travel.  Tory modernisers have always argued that the party is at its best when securing progressive ends by Tory means. Same-sex marriage was one such example. This is another. It is the right thing to do in principle, but it is also an audacious land grab by Osborne, colonising terrain that has long been Labour’s sovereign soil. What will the leadership contenders have to say about this almighty twist in the tale? And will the Tory right be able to stop themselves from ruining it? Stay tuned.  Gaby Hinsliff: Osborne’s cunning trick will leave Labour floundering  The key thing to remember whenever chancellors produce rabbits from hats is that rabbits aren’t actually native to hats. It takes considerable sleight-of-hand to force the damn things in there. Tempting as it is to gawp solely at the rabbit – a compulsory £9-an-hour living wage for all! – it’s usually better to focus gimlet-eyed on the hand. And George Osborne’s was busy rifling pockets.  What he unveiled was actually a more generous than expected rise in the minimum wage, not a living one, since in London the living wage is already £9.15 it’s £7.85 elsewhere and who knows where it might be by 2020. It’s not enough to set good times rolling for families who will start losing tax credits before the £9 minimum kicks in; or to compensate for stunts like the shameless scrapping of student maintenance grants, which unlike tuition fees will directly hit kids from poor families destined for university. The gulf between working people and jobless ones - particularly those sick enough still to get ESA despite tougher new ‘fitness to work’ tests, who will now receive no more than ordinary job seekers’ allowance – will meanwhile widen sharply. There’s trouble ahead.  But the immediate result is to leave Labour floundering, its critique of the Tories as providers of low-wage dead-end jobs in pieces; and there were just enough unexpected moves – curbing the buy-to-let boom by reducing landlords’ tax relief, ending permanent non-dom status – to keep things unpredictable. Osborne’s reputation as a political, if not economic, strategist – and thus his own career prospects – can only be enhanced.  Aditya Chakrabortty: A serious invasion into Labour territory – but not a substantive one  Not content with merely beating Labour in the election, the Tory’s cleverest strategist George Osborne now wants to nick most of their clothes – then club them to death.  This was much more than a victory lap of a budget. Fresh from May’s election win, delivering the first true-blue budget in nearly a quarter of a century, the chancellor could have just stood up, reiterated the measures his minions have been leaking to the papers for the past fortnight and sat down to a roaring ovation. But this afternoon he went so much further, and launched a serious invasion into Labour territory.  First came the finger-jabbing at the opposite side and the references to the Tories being the party to keep its promises. The repeated avowals that the Conservatives were the party of workers. The harking on about establishing the northern powerhouse in Labour heartland and the offer to work with cities across the north of England. Then came the crackdown on non-doms – not hard enough, but much better than anything Blair and Brown managed in their 13 years.  Finally, the rebadging of the minimum wage to being “the national living wage” and the commitment to raise it to £9 an hour by 2020, for those aged 25 and over. Compare that with Ed Miliband’s pre-election pledge to raise the minimum wage to £8 an hour by the end of this decade. Forget about Red Ed, the chancellor appeared to be saying: I am Red George.  So runs the rhetoric, at least. Look at the detail and it is not especially progressive, of course. The rise in the minimum wage is great news – but is undermined by the hacking away at tax credits. I’ll wait to see the impact assessments, but my guess is that low-paid families with children will still be poorer at the end of this decade.  Then think about the cut in inheritance tax – introduced by a Treasury that previously judged that “there are not strong economic arguments for introducing an inheritance tax exemption specifically related to main residences”. Who gains from this apparent dog of an idea? “Disproportionately” the very richest in society, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.  Consider the reduction in corporation tax – in a country that already has lower corporation tax rates and more generous corporation tax benefits than the US, Germany or any of our major competitors. As we reported in the Guardian this week, the government that is lopping billions from the social welfare budget hands businesses £93bn a year in direct corporate welfare – the equivalent of £3,500 from each and every household in Britain.  Look at the utterly bizarre attacks on housing associations, already struggling to keep on top of the benefits changes imposed on their tenants. Now Osborne wants to go further by forcing them to sell their houses at a discount and cut rent – houses he doesn’t own and rent he doesn’t collect.  But then look across at a Labour frontbench in disarray at the prospect of spending another decade out of power, too frightened to say anything leftwing. Her Majesty’s opposition is retreating from their own territory – leaving Osborne to rush in and plant a big blue flag on it. Do not underestimate the political seriousness behind this budget: just like the last Conservative governments of Thatcher and Lawson and Major, this administration is getting together a cogent true-blue appeal to working- and middle-class voters. Yes, it’s cruel to those in low-paid or no work, even while directing cash to the richest. But I wouldn’t bet on a timid, uninspired Labour party to point that out – or defend its own turf.",truth
753da2b7,"Coronavirus: Malaria drug hydroxychloroquine 'most effective' What is the coronavirus?  A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown.  The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2.  Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it.  The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.  Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals.  'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease Severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS coronaviruses.  'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.'  The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31.  By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge.  The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.  Where does the virus come from?  According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats. Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals – the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively.  The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation.  Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat.  A study by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats.  However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.  Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China.  'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.'  So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?  Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly.  It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19.  Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold.  Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them.  'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.'  If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.  'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.  'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.'  How does the virus spread?  The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms.  It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces.  Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person.  What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms?  Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms – but they may still be contagious during this time.  If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever high temperature. The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all.  In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.  Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why.  What have genetic tests revealed about the virus?  Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world.  This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.  Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much – changing is known as mutating – much during the early stages of its spread.  However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people.  This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it.  More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately.  How dangerous is the virus?  The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people.  Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is.  However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true.  Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured?  The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain.  Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money.  No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above.  The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology.  Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people.  People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public.  And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill infection causes a raised temperature.  However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport.  Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic?  The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'.  Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world.",fake
246c4405,"Cuts, cuts, cuts. Headteachers tell of school system ‘that could implode’ A report by the National Audit Office has said schools face cuts of 8% in real terms by 2019-20. While the government said school funding would be ringfenced, headteachers are facing a mountain of increased costs: higher contributions to national insurance and teachers’ pensions, the introduction of the “national living wage”, pay rises and the apprenticeship levy. There’s no extra money for these, nor is funding per pupil rising in line with inflation. The NAO warned that cuts could put students’ “educational outcomes at risk”. To make matters worse, the education services grant, worth £600m, is also being cut, which means there will be less money for local authorities or academies to provide services such as school improvement.  Meanwhile, headteachers are nervously keeping an eye on proposals for a new funding formula for schools in 2018-19, expected to redistribute money from inner-city schools to rural areas. But even schools that are likely to gain under this model say any extra cash will be eaten up by increased costs.  ‘We’ve cut our counsellor’s hours despite suicide attempts’  Everything has been cut. We used to spend lots of money on speech therapy, especially in primary, but the number of hours has been cut. Our gangs worker has gone, our drugs worker has gone. These were important people in our area, where students need this support.  Our counsellor has had her hours cut. I have a number of students on suicide risk assessments because they have attempted suicide, either at home or at school. For those children, part of their risk assessment is that they see the therapist. Apart from one, who has become a school phobic, they’re all in and attending and mostly succeeding. I think you can attribute that to the therapy. My concern is that there’s a fairly big waiting list of kids who haven’t tried to kill themselves and I can’t get them into therapy, because we haven’t got enough capacity. There’s absolutely no help outside of school.  The only thing we haven’t cut is the classroom teachers, but staffing has become leaner. We’ve lost teaching assistants, admin staff, senior leaders and this has included redundancies. If a teaching assistant leaves, we replace them with someone cheaper – fewer hours or less responsibility. In the past three years we’ve lost 25 people.  At Christmas time, we used to get theatre companies in to do pantomimes, because a lot of our children’s families just don’t do that sort of thing. It would cost £350 and normally we’d ask for contributions from parents - we’d get £100 in and then we’d top it up. We can’t top it up any more. This year it didn’t happen.  The gap between my kids and some of the other schools in the area is widening at a frightening rate. Parents elsewhere are stepping up and paying for things. But in my school I’ve got more than one family per year group where this Christmas the kids didn’t get any presents and they sat in their bedrooms eating sandwiches. I can’t fix that, but I can try to make coming to school as much fun as possible. Headteacher, west of England      David Waugh, headteacher, Cheshire: ‘I can’t afford my own special needs coordinator, so I share. I’m a school of 1,500 and the other school has 1,100 students’  ‘I’m running nine-year-old computers’    I’ve got my training budget for staff down to £10,000 – I have 178 staff and the guidance says it should be around £70,000-£80,000. At a time when the government has changed every course, every exam curriculum, I’m struggling to cope with training my staff and I can’t afford to resource these courses.  I have 32 A-levels for my sixth formers at the moment, and I’m putting them into three categories: A-levels I’ll deliver myself, A-levels I’m going to have to find a different way of delivering, and A-levels I will never offer again. Some A-levels, such as music and languages, I may have to run jointly with other schools. I can’t afford my own special needs coordinator [who makes sure pupils with disabilities or special needs get the right support], so I share one with another school. I’m a school of 1,500 and the other school has 1,100 students. I’ve restructured everything. Over the last few years I’ve taken 13.2 full-time equivalent teaching staff out of the system through redundancy and non-replacement of staff. This includes two members of the senior leadership team. I don’t put any money into computers, I’m running nine-year-old computers.  There’s not a morose feeling in my school because it’s a bloody good school and people want to stay. But if I were in a different school, with a different demographic, it would be catastrophic.  As a local authority area, we are the sixth worst-funded schools in the country. A lot of us have been holding out for the national funding formula to save us. But Cheshire East will become officially the 150th in the list of 150 local authorities under the new funding formula. We’ll go from sixth worst to the worst. I can’t cut back any more. David Waugh, Poynton High School, Poynton, Cheshire  Sean Maher, headteacher, Greater London: ‘If we do not sort out the problem, within two to three years the system could implode.’  ‘We can’t offer computer science as we can’t afford a teacher’  Over the last three years we’ve adopted a policy of not replacing staff where we don’t have to, and last year we ended up making four people redundant. It was the most brutal thing I’ve ever had to do, it was just horrible.  If you’re in education and you’re working with children you want staff who are happy and pulling together – try doing that and also saying “some of you are losing your jobs”. It has a massive effect on the children. We rely so much on our teachers; we’re an outstanding school and do loads and loads of wider curricular activities. Staff do that without charge, through goodwill. They’re not going to keep doing things like that if morale isn’t high.  We’ve had to look at our curriculum offer and say “well we can’t offer computer science to this year group because we can’t replace that member of staff”.  With these new courses coming out across A-levels and GCSE, staff are coming to me and saying “I want £2,500 to buy a new set of textbooks”. I say “no, I can’t afford them, find another way to do it”. With everything, you’re just trying to find ways of penny pinching. If something in the building breaks we won’t fix it unless we have to.  We’ve been told there’s no more money in the pot. One of the things I find galling is that when the prime minister decides she has a policy she wants to announce, like let’s have more grammar schools, they suddenly find millions to set up new grammar schools.  Education is at a tipping point – I really do think if we do not sort out the funding problem and the recruitment crisis, then within two to three years the whole system could implode. Fantastic, dedicated classroom practitioners will just turn around and say: I’m not going to carry on doing this job any more, not for this money, not for this workload, not with this amount of stress. Sean Maher, Richard Challoner school, New Malden, Greater London  ‘No wonder teachers are leaving, they’ve had enough’  We are running on a skeleton staff. We have some classes of 34; we went up to 35 at one point because we couldn’t afford to open a new class.  We have a boy in a wheelchair who needs one-to-one support but he’s not funded for one-to-one, so I’m pulling staff from other classes who should be supporting other children. We haven’t got enough staff.  You end up with a teacher with 34 children in a class, with many with special needs and medical problems, and you don’t get medical support [which used to pay for a member of staff to be specially trained] any more. We have a child with diabetes who keeps passing out; we don’t get any medical funding to support her. No wonder teachers are leaving; they’ve had enough.  Over the last two to three years I’ve been really prudent with the budget, but next year we’ll start going into deficit.  We don’t use teachers for supply any more; we use higher level teaching assistants. We used to have a capital budget [which pays for improvements to the school premises] that was quite large; now it’s £6,000. I’ve had to apply to the local authority to have my roof replaced and I’ve got to provide the first £15,000. I’ve got to find the money somehow. That means next year I won’t be able to spend anything on my curriculum budgets – literacy resources, numeracy resources, IT spending and so on.  Some schools have a dedicated family liaison person, but none of the schools in Cambridgeshire does because we just can’t afford it. I’m sitting here counselling the same parents week on week, having massive arguments with them about attendance, because I’m going to be judged on attendance. I’m constantly referring cases to social services – who say it doesn’t meet the threshold. Primary head, Cambridgeshire  Helen Longton Howorth, headteacher, Brighton: ‘You’re having a conversation with teachers about whether to buy a set of Pritt Sticks. It’s ridiculous.’  ‘I worry about asking parents for money’  In Brighton we’ve got a peculiar situation where in the city centre, schools – the more middle-class schools – are full, but on the outskirts our funding problem is that we’re not full. I’ve got 100 or so places that I can’t fill. You get £3,000 per child, so you’re looking at £300,000 I’m already down on my budget before you’re even thinking about funding cuts.  We’re only not in deficit because I have a good business manager and we’re spending absolutely no money. We don’t hire supply teachers, we have one person who is in-house supply. If anybody is off sick we tend to split classes or use learning mentors to cover because we can’t afford supply teachers. Heaven forbid if anybody goes long-term sick leave because that would tip the budget into the red. It’s a massive worry.  I’m spending a lot of time thinking creatively about how to make money. We are having to make ourselves into marketable commodities – we’re thinking all the time about how to creatively raise funds, divert funds or not spend funds. Our PTA and fundraising events are funding our equipment. All the computers are funded through the PTA.  At Christmas, the children all made decorations in class and sold them to parents. We filmed the school play ourselves, spent the weekend burning many, many DVDs, sold them cheaply to parents, and we made £600 from things like that. That went to pay for resources to use in lessons. You worry about the fact that, for example, we charge parents £1 a ticket to come and watch the children’s play.  It’s come to the point that you’re having a conversation with teachers about whether they can afford to buy a set of Pritt Sticks before the end of the financial year – that’s quite ridiculous.

f92d4814,"Laura Trott and Jason Kenny win gold medals in Team GB's greatest overseas Olympics R io 2016 is officially Great Britain's best overseas Olympics after they surpassed the Beijing tally of 47 medals with five days of action still to go.  Boxer Josh Buatsi's bronze took Britain to 48 medals as they surpassed the previous best tally in Beijing eight years ago, and they had 50 in the bag by the end of play on Tuesday.  Moments after Buatsi's medal was confirmed, cyclist Jason Kenny triumphed in the men's Keirin to take Team GB's tally of gold medals to 19 in Rio - the same amount won in Beijing.  It was a golden day for Kenny and his fiancee Laura Trott, with the engaged couple's gold medal tally into double figures - with the pair now able to boast 10 between them.  Great Britain's Olympic gold rush - who's won what in Rio so far?  Trott became the first British woman to claim four Olympic gold medals with her win in the Omnium, while Kenny equalled the British record haul of Sir Chris Hoy after winning his sixth Olympic gold by scooping the top title in the keirin.  There is still a lot of work to do to equal the London 2012 tally of 65 medals, 29 of which were gold, but plenty of chances remain.  Trott cried on the sidelines as Kenny pedalled his victory lap with his arms in the air, before the couple embraced and kissed as the crowd cheered.  Speaking to the BBC following his win, Kenny said:  Today just felt like a dream really, I think I'm just kind of so tired I'm just floating through it. So yeah, I really enjoyed today.

664308f8,"Plastic straws and cotton buds to be banned next year in effort to tackle plastic pollution Plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds are to be banned in England from April next year in a move campaigners have welcomed but warned will “only scratch the surface” in tackling the damage that non-degradable waste is doing to the environment.  The environment secretary Michael Gove confirmed the ban on the supply of the items after an open consultation revealed “overwhelming” public support for the move.  The ban will include exemptions to ensure that those with medical needs or a disability are able to continue to access plastic straws, the government said.  Mr Gove said: “Urgent and decisive action is needed to tackle plastic pollution and protect our environment. These items are often used for just a few minutes but take hundreds of years to break down, ending up in our seas and oceans and harming precious marine life.  “So today I am taking action to turn the tide on plastic pollution, and ensure we leave our environment in a better state for future generations.”  Senegal's plastic waste crisis Show all 10 1 /10 Senegal's plastic waste crisis Senegal's plastic waste crisis Senegalese boys play on a section of beach that has been eroded away by a big storm revealing layers of waste in the beach sand in the fishing village Yenne Todd in Senegal, 24 February 2019.

EPA-EFE  In England, it is estimated we use 4.7 billion plastic straws, 316 million plastic stirrers and 1.8 billion plastic-stemmed cotton buds a year, according to government figures.  An estimated 10 per cent of cotton buds are flushed down toilets and can end up in waterways and oceans.  weekly exclusive email The Independent Climate Newsletter Get our Free Climate Newsletter Sign up for news and advice on saving the planet Email Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address sign up I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our privacy notice Thanks for signing up to the  Climate newsletter  The consultation revealed 80 per cent of respondents backed a ban on the distribution and sale of plastic straws, 90 per cent backed a ban on drinks stirrers, and 89 percent supported a ban on cotton buds.  Paper straws and cotton buds with paper stems are already widely available.  It is estimated there is over 150 million tonnes of plastic waste polluting the world’s oceans and every year around a million birds and over 100,000 sea mammals die from eating and getting tangled in plastic waste.  A recent report estimates the quantity of plastic in the sea will treble by 2025.  The ban on straws, stirrers and cotton buds is the latest policy announced by the UK government to crackdown on plastic.  The plastic microbeads ban came into force last year, and the 5p plastic bag charge was introduced in 2015 – which the government says has led to nine billion fewer bags distributed.  Sam Chetan-Welsh, political campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “It’s been a long time coming, but we welcome the news that DEFRA are finally enforcing a ban on throwaway plastics like straws, cotton buds and stirrers. The reality is though that these bans only scratch the surface.  “To really tackle the plastic crisis we need bigger bolder action from this government – including targets to radically reduce the production of single-use plastics and an all-inclusive deposit return scheme for drinks containers.”  Laura Foster, from the Marine Conservation Society, said: “We are delighted with this government decision which will help consumers move to a more plastic-free lifestyle.  ✕ Support free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events  “Surveys last year during our Great British Beach Clean showed, for instance, that cotton buds were in the Top 10 items found by volunteers – with an average 17 found per every 100 metres of beach in England. It’s right that plastic cotton buds should be banned.  “While we strongly welcome today’s announcement, we now need Michael Gove to go further in moving to reduce plastic consumption overall and increase recycling rates, particularly with a fully inclusive deposit return scheme for bottles and glass.  “It’s clear that the public mood has changed and what we need to see now is further action by retailers and the government to encourage a move against all single use plastic and to improve recycling.”  Lauren West, from Muscular Dystrophy UK, said: “Plastic straws are sometimes the only type of straw that work for disabled people due to their flexibility and ability to be used in hot and cold drinks.  “We’re pleased the government has recognised this in its proposals put forward today.”",fake
58985a7d,"kill by mouth NHS hospitals plunged into crisis as up to two patients die each DAY of thirst or starvation Families' venting fury at needless tragedies as overworked staff fail sick and elderly who are being 'forgotten to death' Exclusive      Shaun Wooller      8 Jan 2017, 23:11Updated: 10 Jan 2017, 8:20  AT LEAST two Brits a day are dying of thirst or starvation in our ­hospitals and care homes.  The appalling statistic heaped pressure on Health Secretary ­Jeremy Hunt to come to the aid of the crisis-ravaged NHS. Out of sight ... patients are being “forgotten to death” in a social care scandal that sparked nationwide fury last night 10 Out of sight ... patients are being “forgotten to death” in a social care scandal that sparked nationwide fury last nightCredit: Alamy  Age UK last night  described the situation as “horrifying”.  Critics blame the back-breaking workloads piled on NHS staff, many of whom lack the time to help patients eat and drink.  Pressure groups also point to the poor quality of the food served up.  Malnutrition was mentioned on the death certificates of 297 patients who died in hospital during 2015, while dehydration was cited on 429.  For care homes, the figures were 54 and 76 respectively.  Many of the patients will have been unable to hold cups or cutlery, others may have forgotten they need to eat.  In 47 of the dehydration cases and 66 of the malnutrition incidents, that was identified as the main cause of death. Hunger and thirst were a factor in the remaining 743. 'Forgotten to death' ... critics blame the back-breaking workloads piled on NHS staff, many of whom lack the time to help patients eat and drink 10 'Forgotten to death' ... critics blame the back-breaking workloads piled on NHS staff, many of whom lack the time to help patients eat and drinkCredit: Getty Images  Across the year, an average of two patients died either malnourished or dehydrated every day.  Ian Mack, whose dad died from dehydration in hospital in 2008, said: “He was absolutely forgotten to death.”  Patient Concern’s Joyce Robins, said last night: “Every one of these deaths is a tragedy.  “Hospital wards are full and staff are run off their feet looking after so many patients it is impossible to give them the care they need.  “Patients will need help eating or drinking but are being neglected.”  The figures, from the Office of National Statistics, come after the British Red Cross warned of a “humanitarian crisis” in the NHS.  And Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said on Friday: “The emergency care system is on its knees, despite the huge efforts of staff.”  Overwhelmed casualty units are failing to meet key performance targets and are turning ambulances away.  The government has slashed spending on social care, swamped doctors and nurses are dealing with record numbers of patients and care homes are struggling to recruit staff. Grief ... Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has previously spoken of his devastation after hearing how a 100-year-old patient died of dehydration 10 Grief ... Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has previously spoken of his devastation after hearing how a 100-year-old patient died of dehydrationCredit: PA:Press Association  Inspections revealed 312 care homes were failing to adequately feed and hydrate residents between January 2015 and November 2016.  That accounts for one in 50 care homes, looking after 11,500 people.  Data also shows millions of patient meals are thrown away every day.  Caroline Abrahams, from Age UK said: “It’s horrifying to think that older people are dying because they haven’t had enough to eat or drink in care homes and hospitals.  “If malnutrition is left untreated it has serious consequences, as these new figures show.” Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has previously spoken of his devastation after hearing how a 100-year-old patient died of dehydration.  Great-grandmother Lydia Spilner died at Leicester Royal Infirmary in February 2012 after her daughter’s pleas for a drip were ignored.  University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust admitted Lydia died of kidney failure caused by dehydration and paid her family an undisclosed sum.  Mr Hunt said at the time: “That story is devastating. There are still too many places where the patient is not foremost in the considerations.”  The NHS Litigation Authority said £311,750 has been paid in compensation to patients and their families in the last five years after they claimed poor care caused malnutrition.

This may mean sitting with them to help them eat and drink.  “The government has an important role in making sure the funding is in place to support good quality care.

87a297a2,"NHS Long Term Plan to tackle major killer conditions and save up to half a million lives The NHS Long Term Plan, published today, will save almost half a million more lives with practical action on major killer conditions and investment in world class, cutting edge treatments including genomic tests for every child with cancer.  The blueprint to make the NHS fit for the future will use the latest technology, such as digital GP consultations for all those who want them, coupled with early detection and a renewed focus on prevention to stop an estimated 85,000 premature deaths each year.  Measures outlined by NHS leaders today will help prevent 150,000 heart attacks, strokes and dementia cases while more than three million people will benefit from new and improved stroke, respiratory and cardiac services over the next decade.  Patients will benefit from services ranging from improved neonatal care for new parents and babies to life-changing stroke therapy and integrated support to keep older people out of hospital, living longer and more independent lives.  The NHS Long Term Plan is also the first time in the NHS’ 70 year history when there will be a new guarantee that investment in primary, community and mental health care will grow faster than the growing overall NHS budget. This will fund a £4.5 billion new service model for the 21st century across England, where health bodies come together to provide better, joined up care in partnership with local government.  The commitment to tackle major physical conditions comes alongside the biggest ever investment in mental health services rising to at least £2.3 billion a year by 2023/24. Building on significant expansion in recent years, the long term plan will see around two million more people who suffer anxiety, depression or other problems receive help over the next decade including new dads as well as mums, and 24 hour access to crisis care via NHS 111.  The NHS Long Term Plan will also:  Open a digital ‘front door’ to the health service, allowing patients to be able to access health care at the touch of a button  Provide genetic testing for a quarter of people with dangerously high inherited cholesterol, reaching around 30,000 people  Give mental health help to 345,000 more children and young people through the expansion of community based services, including in schools  Use cutting edge scans and technology, including the potential use of artificial intelligence, to help provide the best stroke care in Europe with over 100,000 more people each year accessing new, better services  Invest in earlier detection and better treatment of respiratory conditions to prevent 80,000 hospital admissions and smart inhalers will be piloted so patients can easily monitor their condition, regardless of where they are  Ensure every hospital with a major A&E department has ‘same day emergency care’ in place so that patients can be treated and discharged with the right package of support, without needing an overnight stay.  NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: “The NHS has been marking its 70th anniversary, and the national debate has rightly centred on three big truths. There’s been pride in our health service’s enduring success, and in the shared social commitment it represents. There’s been concern – about funding, staffing, increasing inequalities and pressures from a growing and ageing population. And there’s also been legitimate optimism – about the possibilities for continuing medical advance and better outcomes of care.  “In looking ahead to the Health Service’s 80th birthday, this NHS Long Term Plan acts on all three of these realities. It keeps all that’s good about our health service and its place in our national life. It tackles head-on the pressures our staff face. And it sets a practical, costed, phased route map for the NHS’s priorities for care quality and outcomes improvement for the decade ahead.”  Seventy years after the NHS was founded, the health service will expand care for patients and their families at every stage of life, supporting people to start well, live well and age well.  The NHS will be the first health service in the world to offer whole genome sequencing for children with cancer and young people who have a rare genetic disorder, in addition to adults suffering from certain rare conditions or specific cancers.  The new, individually tailored treatments will be introduced alongside cutting edge testing services that will mean three quarters of cancer patients are diagnosed early, when the condition is easier to treat, up from half at present, saving 55,000 lives a year.  Around 23,000 premature deaths and 50,000 hospital admissions will be prevented over the next decade by putting over 100,000 patients with heart problems through a healthy living and exercise programme every year.  Children and young people’s health will be a priority with the introduction of a new transformation programme to oversee delivery of commitments for the next ten years, from bringing mental and physical care together to services for 0-25 years so that care is timely and continuous.  A renewed focus on prevention including action to help people live healthier lives will stop thousands of people developing life threatening or limiting conditions, including the expansion of the Diabetes Prevention Programme.  And as more people live longer, care will increasingly be delivered in people’s homes or somewhere convenient, freeing up space in hospitals for those who need it most.  Ian Dalton, chief executive of NHS Improvement, said: “At the heart of the NHS are hard-working staff who pull out all the stops to care for patients every day. It is thanks to their dedication that the NHS is admired around the world and that it has taken great strides over the last seven decades.  “We need to build on these achievements and make the best use of the new investment to fundamentally reset how the NHS is run so that our growing and ageing population can get the right care at the right time and in the right place.  “This means breaking down organisational barriers to take a more holistic approach to how care is delivered and paid for, embracing new and existing forms of technology, recruiting and retaining the right number of staff, and shifting the focus away from hospitals to prevention and care in the community.  “Developed by those working within the NHS, the long term plan sets out an exciting roadmap for how we will do this together for the benefit of patients.”  Professor Carrie MacEwen, chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges said: “It’s good to have a plan which sets a clear direction for the NHS and tackles many of the issues the Academy has long been saying need to be addressed if we are to improve patient care. Our challenge now is to make sure it’s properly implemented and in this regard we, that is everyone who works in the NHS and patients who use the service, must all play our part if we are to make it a success.”  Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation said: “This plan is a welcome and significant step in the fight against heart and circulatory diseases, which promises to save thousands of lives in the coming years.  “The plan’s strong focus on improving prevention and detection of heart and circulatory diseases and their risk factors has the potential to make a huge difference, ensuring that deaths rates fall further in the future. In addition, better care and support for people living with heart failure will significantly improve quality of life for many.  “It’s now essential that work gets underway on making this transformational plan a reality.”  Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind, said: “We are really pleased to see that mental health is such a key focus in the NHS long term plan and we welcome the £2.3bn set aside for mental health services. This is the kind of sustained investment we need to see to put mental health on an equal footing with physical health and, if delivered, this plan will make a difference to the lives of thousands of people with mental health problems.  “Everyone now needs to work together to develop the workforce needed and to deliver these plans and to ensure the money reaches the frontline. Local decision makers need to develop their own plans and the proof of delivery will be in the experiences of people trying to access the services they need.”  Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan, said:  “It’s been a privilege to work with NHSE shaping the cancer section of the long term plan. I’m delighted that cancer has continued to remain a high priority. One in two people will get a cancer diagnosis during their lifetime and the plan lays out important milestones around improving survival and ensuring high quality personalised care for every patient. I look forward to continuing to work with the NHS to meet these milestones and to improve cancer care for patients now and in the future.”",other
66e01970,"Liberal Democrat MP tables new law to make 'upskirting' a criminal offence A Liberal Democrat MP has tabled a parliamentary bill that would make it a criminal offence to take a photo up a person’s skirt without their permission.  Wera Hobhouse introduced the bill after discovering “upskirting” is not illegal because there is no specific crime covering the act.  As a result, police have often been unable to charge people found to be taking inappropriate photos of women without their permission.  Ms Hobhouse’s bill would amend the Sexual Offences Act 2003 to add upskirting as an offence under a section on voyeurism.  The proposals would see anyone convicted of the crime given a fine or a jail term of up to two years.  The Bath MP is due to meet with government ministers to discuss the bill, which she hopes will be passed with cross-party support.  Upskirting was made illegal in Scotland in 2009 but equivalent legislation has not been passed in England and Wales. Ms Hobhouse’s proposed law is based on the Scottish version.

Speaking to The Independent, Ms Hobhouse said: “It’s a very vile practice – it’s humiliating, it’s degrading, it doesn’t fit with what we as women expect to encounter in the 21st Century.  “It’s discriminating and disgusting and there’s a very simple change that would make it a criminal offence.”  She added: “It’s never happened to me, luckily, but I know how embarrassed and awful I would feel if somebody had done that to me.  “It makes you immediately sympathise and think ‘this should absolutely be stopped’.”  International Women’s Day: groundbreaking figures from history Show all 17 1 /17 International Women’s Day: groundbreaking figures from history International Women’s Day: groundbreaking figures from history Radical political activist Angela Davis speaks at a protest in Raleigh Getty International Women’s Day: groundbreaking figures from history Poor pay, 14 hour days and dangerous working conditions led to a strike by around 1400 women and girls at a match factory in Bow, London, 1888.

It follows a petition set up by Gina Martin, 25, who was the victim of upskirting at a music festival last summer but was told by police that the culprit could not be charged because the offence was not technically a crime.  Ms Martin said: “I am delighted that Wera Hobhouse and her colleagues in the Liberal Democrats have decided to support my campaign to introduce a specific upskirting offence.  “During her work on this bill with my lawyer Ryan Whelan, at Gibson Dunn, I have seen first-hand just how much Wera wants to get this right, how much she, like me, wants to ensure that upskirters can be prosecuted appropriately in all circumstances.  “I believe this bill achieves that and I look forward to other politicians from across the political divide joining Wera, Ryan and I in working to implore [Justice Secretary] David Gauke – and others in government – to close this gap in the law.”  The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners has previously said a new law is needed to make upskirting a sexual offence.  Vera Baird QC, the organisation’s lead on matters relating to victims, said the current law “is far from clear” because there is “no specific offence relating to the taking of pictures for sexual gratification without the victim’s knowledge or consent”.",partial
8c7cfe8f,"Hospitals deluged by 5,000 diabetics a DAY: One in 10 admissions is for diabetes One in ten patients admitted to hospital are suffering from a form of diabetes linked to being overweight and inactive.  The scale of the growing crisis was laid bare last night as it was revealed hospitals are being deluged with 5,000 type 2 diabetes patients every day.  It is taking an unprecedented toll on the under-pressure NHS, with doctors now seeing children aged under nine who need help.  The reason the illness is so burdensome for the NHS is its devastating complications, which include heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure and amputations. The figures show there were 4,992 admissions for women aged 20 to 29 in 2018/19, compared with 1,755 for men [File photo]  GP leaders also warned that some patients need up to 200 health appointments a year to deal with their condition.  There were more than 1.7million admissions of patients with type 2 diabetes last year, costing the NHS an estimated £22million a day.  An admission can count the same patient more than once.  The figure has doubled in a decade and last night the head of the NHS warned: ‘Our ever-expanding waistlines are taking a growing toll.’  Simon Stevens warned the ‘alarming rise’ in admissions across the board was putting ‘avoidable pressure’ on our hospitals.  The figures also reveal there were 940 admissions involving children and teenagers aged 19 and under in 2018/19. This included 45 admissions for children aged nine or under – a shocking statistic for an illness once only seen in middle-aged adults [File photo]  The illness appears to be having a worrying impact on younger women, according to the latest data from NHS Digital.  Two thirds of the type 2 diabetes admissions for the under-40s last year involved female patients and there is evidence they are more susceptible to complications.  The data only covers those patients with type 2 diabetes, which is strongly linked to being overweight and inactive – and largely preventable.  The reason the illness is so burdensome for the NHS is its devastating complications, which include heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure and amputations.  The figures show there were 4,992 admissions for women aged 20 to 29 in 2018/19, compared with 1,755 for men.  GP leaders also warned that some patients need up to 200 health appointments a year to deal with their condition. There were more than 1.7million admissions of patients with type 2 diabetes last year [File photo]  Similarly, there were 16,707 admissions for women aged 30 to 39 compared with 10,207 for men. Overall women accounted for 65 per cent of the 34,601 admissions among the under-40s last year.  Although type 2 diabetes is more common in men, research has shown women are more at risk of complications arising from it including heart disease, kidney disease as well as depression.  Disturbingly, the figures also reveal there were 940 admissions involving children and teenagers aged 19 and under in 2018/19. This included 45 admissions for children aged nine or under – a shocking statistic for an illness once only seen in middle-aged adults.  Regardless of their age or sex, most patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes will need to take medication and attend regular check-ups for the rest of their lives.  Mr Stevens, chief executive of the NHS, said: ‘Our ever-expanding waistlines are taking a growing toll on our families’ health and on our NHS, with this alarming rise in admissions demonstrating the avoidable pressure it is putting on hospitals.  ‘The NHS Long Term Plan is more than playing its part, with plans to prevent 200,000 people a year from developing type 2 diabetes, but wider society including supermarkets and retailers need to step up in the battle against the bulge.’  Caroline Cerny of the Obesity Health Alliance, a coalition of 40 organisations which are aiming to reduce obesity levels, said: ‘Obesity significantly increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and that’s why we need the Government to take strong action to protect children’s health, with comprehensive restrictions to curb the relentless marketing and promotion of junk food.’  One in ten patients admitted to hospital are suffering from a form of diabetes linked to being overweight and inactive. The scale of the crisis was laid bare last night as it was revealed hospitals are being deluged with 5,000 type 2 diabetes patients every day [File photo]  An estimated 4.7million adults and children in Britain are living with diabetes, and the majority have type 2. This number has doubled since 1998, in line with rising obesity levels and the condition is believed to cost the NHS £14billion annually.  To gauge the impact of the illness on hospitals, the Mail analysed admission data from NHS Digital for the last ten years.  This revealed there were 1,749,025 admissions for type 2 diabetes in 2018/19, up from 1,637,565 in 2017/18 and 924,536 in 2009/10. An admission could include a planned check-up for diabetes as well as one for a complication – or an emergency admission via A&E.  After the age of 40, men catch up with women and go on to account for a higher proportion of admissions for patients aged 50 to 90.  This is probably because men are more likely to get type 2 diabetes and the illness most commonly develops in the over 50s. However, previous studies have suggested women with type 2 diabetes are more susceptible to heart disease and strokes.  The diabetics who use NHS 200 times a year  By Sophie Borland, Health Editor for the Daily Mail  Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard above said adults in the ‘later stages’ of the condition required daily consultations or home visits  Diabetes is putting a huge strain on GP surgeries with patients needing up to 200 NHS appointments a year, a top doctor has revealed.  Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard said adults in the ‘later stages’ of the condition required daily consultations or home visits.  She said the ‘steady increase’ in the number of new cases was creating ‘significant problems’ for surgeries, which are already under intense pressure. The head of the Royal College of GPs also revealed how patients are developing symptoms 20 years earlier in life than compared to when she first qualified in the early 2000s.  Professor Stokes-Lampard, who represents 52,000 GPs in the UK, said: ‘Every person who is diagnosed is going to need several appointments with their GP, several appointments with the practice sister, education, lifestyle, then the optician, and chiropodist foot specialist.  ‘In your first year of diabetes you’ve probably got eight to ten health-related appointments, assuming everything goes to plan. Then you’re going to need monitoring for the rest of your life with blood tests, you’ll probably need medication for the rest of your life.  ‘If you have complications however – a patient whose control hasn’t been good, is in the later stages, could need to be seen in the surgery daily.  ‘You could have 200 appointments a year or a district nurse who is calling to your house daily. This is at the extreme end of the spectrum.’  Diabetes is putting a huge strain on GP surgeries with patients needing up to 200 NHS appointments a year, a top doctor has revealed. GPs are trying to encourage overweight patients to slim down to reduce the rates of diabetes and other health conditions [File photo]  GP surgeries are under intense strain as growing numbers of doctors are taking early retirement or cutting back on their hours, without being replaced.  This is at a time when demand for appointments is going up due to the aging population and the increasing prevalence of lifestyle-related illnesses such as diabetes.  GPs are trying to encourage overweight patients to slim down to reduce the rates of diabetes and other health conditions.  But Professor Stokes-Lampard, who practises in Lichfield, Staffordshire, said one of the hardest parts of her job was telling parents their children were too fat and needed to go on a diet.  She said: ‘If I see a very overweight parent bringing in a child who is heading to the overweight category it’s a difficult conversation to have.  ‘You ask the question have you noticed they’ve gained weight since started going to school, how do you get on with healthy eating at home, you steer the conversation in different ways to work out the reaction and see what motivates them.  ‘Sometimes when people really, really don’t seem to be getting the message you have to have a more direct conversation.’  Although Type 2 diabetes is closely linked to obesity, certain groups are at much higher risk including people of South Asians origin or those with a family history.  Professor Stokes-Lampard said that some patients were so ashamed of having an illness ‘of fat people’ that they refused to take any medication.",partial
6f2dd3a8,"Workers to lose a month’s wages in higher taxes to pay for Corbyn’s reckless spending plans New research reveals that Labour’s reckless spending plans could hand an additional £2,400 bill to every taxpayer every year if Jeremy Corbyn becomes Prime Minister. This figure - the ‘Cost of Corbyn’ - is equivalent to an entire month’s pay for the average earner.  Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour would wrack up a spending bill of an extra £1.2 trillion over the next Parliament. This includes £546 billion of capital expenditure – which their Fiscal Rule would allow them to borrow for. The remaining resource spending of £651 billion would need to be funded through tax measures.  Analysis of Labour’s spending plans shows that there is a £374 billion black hole in their numbers – with only £277 billion of their £651 billion of resource spending covered by taxes under their current plans. Labour will have to put up taxes to cover the shortfall.‍  ‍  The taxes that Corbyn’s Labour are considering bringing in include:    A homes tax.  ‍A movers’ tax.  A gifts tax.  Fuel duty hikes and increased holiday taxes.  ‍  Commenting, Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid said:    “Jeremy Corbyn is planning a reckless spending spree which we will all have to pay for. He will open up a huge black hole in the nation’s finances and hard working people will be the ones that suffer. In order to pay for his policies, he will not only have to massively increase borrowing and debt, he will also need to hike up taxes by £2,400 per person – this is equivalent to an entire month’s pay for the average earner.  “The British people have made huge progress over the last decade in repairing the damage left to us by the last Labour Government. If Jeremy Corbyn gets into power he would throw all that hard work away.  “A vote for Corbyn’s Labour is a vote for higher taxes and the chaos of two more referendums. Only a sensible, majority Conservative Government will get Brexit done and provide the economic certainty that families and businesses need to plan for the future. We simply cannot afford the cost of Corbyn.”    ‍  What you need to know:  John McDonnell has ruled out borrowing to fund for Labour’s day-to-day spending plans.  ‍‘Labour’s Fiscal Credibility Rule does not allow for borrowing for day to day spending. Under our rule, drafted by leading economists, only borrowing for long term investment is allowed.’ John McDonnell, Twitter, 6 January 2019, link  Labour’s day-to-day black hole means that each individual taxpayer in the UK could see their income tax rise by £2,400 a year.  ‍By their own fiscal rules, Labour are not allowed to borrow to fund the £650 billion of day-to-day spending commitments they have made, and would instead need to raise taxes. They have committed to £277 billion in revenue raisers, meaning they have a gap to fill of £374 billion. There are 31,199,000 income taxpayers in the UK, who would each need to pay an extra £12,000 over five years, or £2,400 a year, to cover Labour’s this gap every year HMRC, Number of income taxpayers, 28 June 2019, link.  The average person would have to work an extra 30 days to pay off this increase.  ‍The median weekly wage is £479 – or £394 after tax under current plans.

In addition, distinguished academics are among the 5 new Honorary Queen’s Counsel also appointed today.  The news has been welcomed by the Lord Chancellor, Elizabeth Truss, who is working closely with the legal industry to break down barriers and improve promotion of talent across the board, from law firms to Supreme Court judges.  Lord Chancellor Elizabeth Truss said:  I commend each of the 113 barristers and solicitors, alongside the five Honorary Queen’s Counsel, for their appointments. I want us to tap into all the talents of our society and today’s appointments are a step in the right direction. The number of women and BAME candidates applying and being successful is moving in the right direction. There is more to be done, but my message is clear - when you widen the pool of talent from which lawyers and judges are drawn, you make the justice system stronger.  Today the Judicial Appointments Commission also launches the latest recruitment exercise for High Court judges. The selection process has been changed so the wider merits of all candidates are recognised. For the first time, it opens the door to a wider pool of ‘direct-entry candidates’ – individuals who while exceptionally talented have not had previous judicial experience.  Notes to editors  The list of 2016 to 2017 Queen’s Counsel appointments The 113 Queen’s Counsel QC also known as silks appointments includes: - 31 women applicants of the 56 who applied; last year, 25 of the 48 female applicants were successful - 16 applicants who declared an ethnic origin other than white of the 37 who applied; last year, 9 such applicants out of 32 were appointed QCs are appointed by The Queen, on the advice of the Lord Chancellor. She is in turn advised by an independent Selection Panel which receives and considers each application and makes recommendations as to appointment. The Lord Chancellor will preside over the appointment ceremony, where the rank will formally be bestowed upon successful applicants, at Westminster Hall on 13 February 2017.

22b5eb59,"Coronavirus: Vitamin D deficient 'at higher risk of death' Nearly 99 per cent of Covid-19 patients who are vitamin D deficient die, according to a terrifying study that adds to mounting evidence that the 'sunshine' nutrient could be a coronavirus life-saver.  Indonesian researchers analysed hospital records of 780 people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.  Results revealed 98.9 per cent of infected patients defined as vitamin D deficient — below 20ng/ml — died. Yet this fell to just 4.1 per cent for patients who had enough of the nutrient.  Researchers warned the study was not definitive, however, because the patients with high vitamin D levels were healthier and younger.  It comes as health chiefs are urgently reviewing the use of vitamin D as a coronavirus lifesaver, with several studies suggesting that Covid-19 patients are far more likely to die if they have a deficiency.  One investigation – carried out by Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge – found European countries with lower vitamin D levels have had significantly more pandemic casualties.  The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is conducting a 'rapid evidence review' of the issue – and publication is expected as early as next week.  A graphic, pictured, shows how the Covid-19 death rate is affected by the level of Vitamin D  The main source of vitamin D for most people is daylight - the body can make its own supply of the nutrient when the skin is exposed to UV rays stock image  Researchers at the University of East Anglia in May produced a correlation graph showing the relationship between levels of vitamin D bottom, measured in nmol/l compared to infection numbers of coronavirus. Countries with low vitamin D levels tend to have the highest case rates per million, they found  Data in a Public Health England report showed that the mortality rate - the number of people dying with the coronavirus out of each 100,000 people - was considerably higher for black men than other group. The risk for black women, people of Asian ethnicity, and mixed race people was also higher than for white people of either sex. People with non-white skin are also at a higher risk of vitamin D deficiency because it takes them longer to make it from sunlight  The Indonesian study was not associated with experts from any university, unlike most Covid-19 research.  All five researchers, led by Prabowo Raharusuna, were listed as 'independent'. No details of their scientific backgrounds were provided in the paper.  The research — published in April — has yet to be peer-reviewed by fellow scientists, a process that often uncovers flaws in studies.  The team found vitamin D-deficient patients were 10 times more likely to die when age, gender and co-morbidities were taken into account.  They wrote in the paper: 'When controlling for age, sex, and comorbidity, vitamin D status is strongly associated with Covid-19 mortality outcome of cases.'  And they called for randomised controlled trials — considered the gold-standard of scientific research — to prove whether vitamin D can be a life-saver.  One in five British adults and one in six children is lacking in vitamin D, thanks to poor diets, indoor lifestyles and lack of sunshine.  Experts estimate around 1billion people worldwide are deficient in the vitamin, with the figures having been described as a 'global public health issue'.  Some scientists fear that the lockdown and months of indoor living have cut levels even further.  Some ethnic groups tend to be at higher risk because their skin is less able to make the vitamin in response to sunlight.  Older people are also in danger because the body gets less efficient at producing the vitamin with age.  Public Health England is working with NICE on the review and has asked the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition to carry out a separate report. In other developments in the pandemic:  VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY 'COULD RAISE COVID-19 DEATH RISK' FOR BAME PEOPLE BAME people may face a higher risk of dying from the coronavirus because they are more likely to have a vitamin D deficiency, scientists claim. The pandemic is seeing higher rates of people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds dying if they catch the coronavirus. The reasons are still unknown and will likely be numerous and complicated. But some experts think a lack of vitamin D may play a role. People with darker skin need to spend more time in sunlight in order to get the same amount of vitamin D as a person with lighter skin. For this reason, the NHS suggests people with an African, African-Caribbean or south Asian background could benefit from take a daily supplement throughout the year. Vitamin D may have a protective effect against severe coronavirus by regulating the immune system, and deficiencies of it have been linked to other respiratory viruses. However, the largest study to investigate the link between BAME, Covid-19 and vitamin D in a UK population found no proof. William Henley, a professor of medical statistics at University of Exeter, told MailOnline the link is worth exploring. He said: 'Preliminary research suggests vitamin D levels may also impact on the risk of people suffering from severe COVID-19 infections. 'In the UK and northern European latitudes, vitamin D deficiency is a public health concern because ultraviolet B UVB radiation is of insufficient intensity for vitamin D synthesis during winter months. 'This is a particular concern for people with dark skin, such as those of African, African-Caribbean or south Asian origin, who will need to spend longer in the sun to produce the same amount of vitamin D as someone with lighter skin.'

Vitamin D tablets are extremely cheap – they cost as little as 3p a day – and Public Health England issued guidance in April advising everyone to take the supplements.  A trial being led by Professor Adrian Martineau of Queen Mary University in London is investigating how certain lifestyle factors – including vitamin D levels – affect susceptibility to the virus.  'Vitamin D could almost be thought of as a designer drug for helping the body to handle viral respiratory infections,' he told The Guardian last night.  A review from the University of Surrey, which was published in the British Medical Journal last month, found that vitamin D should be seen as part of a healthy lifestyle but not as a 'magic bullet' – because the evidence was not yet clear.  Dr Lee Smith, who led Anglia Ruskin's study, said: 'It has been shown to protect against acute respiratory infections, and older adults, the group most deficient in vitamin D, are also the ones most seriously affected by Covid-19.  A previous study found that 75 per cent of people in institutions, such as hospitals and care homes were severely deficient in vitamin D.'  A Public Health England spokesman said: 'NICE is working on a rapid evidence summary on vitamin D in the context of Covid-19 with support from Public Health England. This report will be published in due course.'  The NHS says the general consensus is levels of below 25nmol/L — the equivalent of 10ng/ml — in the blood indicate vitamin D deficiency.  This is thought to be the equivalent of taking around 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day.  The Institute of Medicine — a US health advisory body — states levels below 20ng/ml 50nmol/L is a deficiency.  Large doses of vitamin D can be dangerous, with anything above 100 micrograms to be taken only under medical supervision.

991b2922,"Junior doctors' strike: Get back to negotiating table - Hunt Junior doctors have been urged to return to the negotiating table by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who described their 24-hour strike in England as completely unnecessary.    NHS England said about 10,000 junior doctors had reported for duty out of 26,000 scheduled to work the day shift.    Thousands of routine operations have been cancelled during the walkout in protest at a proposed new contract.    The BMA said the strike sent a clear message to the government.    We deeply regret the level of disruption caused, but this is a fight for the long-term safety of patients and junior doctors' working lives, said Dr Johann Malawana, chair of the British Medical Association BMA junior doctors' committee.    He said that junior doctors had no confidence in the new contract.    NHS England apologised to affected patients, and said trusts would try to reschedule cancelled appointments and operations as soon as possible.  'Hardly surprising'    The walkout, which began at 08:00 GMT, comes after talks between the union and government failed to reach agreement on the proposed new contract. The BMA is concerned about pay for weekend working, career progression and safeguards to protect doctors from being overworked.    But ministers have argued the current arrangements are outdated and changes are needed to improve standards of care at the weekend.  media captionEmily Rogers was due to have an operation but it was cancelled because of the strike  media captionConsultant: We'll do whatever is needed to make sure patients are safe    NHS England said more than 3,300 operations had been cancelled on Tuesday - about one in 10 of those planned.    Several hundred more operations have been impacted in the days before and after the strike.    Emily Rogers, from Cheltenham, told the BBC she had been due to have an operation to insert a new feeding tube, which had taken four months to arrange.

Junior doctors who support the industrial action are providing only emergency cover during the 24-hour period.    BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said it was thought many of the 10,000 doctors who turned up were medics who had agreed to work to cover emergency care, although a few thousand were also likely to be doctors who were not members of the BMA and not taking part in strike action.    The BMA said: Since we asked junior doctors who would be covering emergency care to go into work today it is hardly surprising that they have done so along with those who are not members of the BMA.  line  The Sandwell Hospital saga  A demonstrator holds a tray of decorated cakes at a protest by junior doctors outside the Frimley Park Hospital in Frimley, south-west London.image copyrightAFP    By BBC Health editor Hugh Pym    This was supposed to be a day of clear dividing lines with junior doctors going on strike, except those on shifts for urgent and emergency work.    But the understanding clearly broke down at Sandwell Hospital in the West Midlands.    The trust wrote to local junior doctors in a letter dated 11 January, saying they all needed to work because of an internal incident and that it anticipated high patient demand.    Under an agreement struck with the BMA, hospitals can recall striking doctors in the event of life-threatening emergency scenarios.    But the BMA argued Sandwell had not acted in line with the agreement and so instructed members not to heed the hospital management's call.    An awkward stand-off ensued after a handful returned to work. By late afternoon the hospital dropped its call for help and said things were under control.    It was an ominous illustration of what might go wrong in the current fraught atmosphere around the dispute.  line    Mr Hunt said the number that had gone into work showed the values of the vast majority of junior doctors.    We have some disagreements with the BMA over pay. But we all want to promise every patient who uses the NHS the promise of the same high-quality care every day of the week, he said.

Nobody wanted to see industrial action least of all the junior doctors, but we understand why they feel they have no other option, she said.  line  BMA badgeimage copyrightPress Association  What is the dispute about?        The row between junior doctors and the government is over a new contract      Talks broke down in 2014, but the dispute has escalated since the summer after ministers said they would impose the deal      Ministers offered doctors an 11% rise in basic pay last year, but that was offset by curbs to other elements of the pay package, including payments for unsociable hours - they have maintained there is not extra money for junior doctor pay      The government says the changes are needed to create more seven-days services, but the BMA warns safeguards to keep a lid on excessive hours are being weakened      The union balloted its members in the autumn, and 98% of those who voted backed strike action      Talks restarted in December, leading to three days of strikes being called off, but these have so far failed to reach a breakthrough, which is why strikes are taking place      A 48-hour strike is scheduled for Tuesday 26 January - emergency cover will again be provided      An all-out junior doctors' strike is planned for Wednesday 10 February - emergency cover will not be provided      Talks are ongoing and the two sides are set to get around the table again later this week    The junior doctors row explained    What exactly do junior doctors do?

The BMA had refused to agree to the request, arguing it was not clear whether the situation qualified as a major incident.    The number we have been able to safely discharge has increased so that services are safe for tonight and tomorrow, a hospital spokeswoman later said.

NHS trusts are now working hard to reschedule cancelled tests, appointments and operations as soon as is possible.    The Patients Association, an independent health charity, urged both sides to continue discussions.    Any new contract must offer terms that are fair for doctors and protect them.

c46da247,"Majority of UK graduates are being forced into non-graduate work, says study The majority of UK graduates are being forced into jobs which do not need their talents, according to a newly-published study.  Research for the CIPD Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, which represents human resource managers, shows 58.8 per cent of UK graduates have ended up in non-graduate jobs - a figure exceeded only by Greece and Estonia.  Around one in twelve of those working in low skilled occupations - such as in coffee shops, bars, call centres and front of house at hospitality events - are now graduates, according to the figures.  The research also shows that the UK has the second highest graduation ration amongst Western nations belonging to the OECD - behind Iceland. It shows it has a 54 per cent graduation rate. Germany, by contrast, has a rate of just 31 per cent.  It concludes the growth of graduates is “significantly outstripping the growth of high-skilled jobs generated by the labour market” in most OECD countries. However, it adds the trend is “particularly pronounced in the UK”.  “The assumption that we will transition to a more productive, higher value higher skilled economy by just increasing the conveyor belt of graduates is proven to be flawed,” said Peter Cheese, chief executive of the CIPD.  Instead, employers have started using degrees as a determinant when recruiting for what have traditionally been non-graduate jobs.

Read our privacy notice  “Many graduates are simply replacing non-graduates in less demanding jobs or entering jobs where the demand for graduate skills is non-existent or falling,” says the report.  “This trend has particularly affected occupations where apprenticeships have been historically important such as construction and manufacturing.”  The report’s findings emerge as UK universities are about to enrol a record number of graduates this autumn following the Government’s decision to lift the cap on the number of students universities can recruit.  Around one in 12 people working in low-skilled occupations in the UK are graduates Getty Getty Images  That, coupled with thousands of students aiming to beat the Government’s decision to axe maintenance grants from next September by forgoing gap years, means the number of recruits to universities is set to beat last year’s all-time high of half a million.  Figures published by UCAS, the university and colleges admissions service, showed 461, 120 had already been signed up for university courses this year - a three per cent rise on the same point last year. Of these, 34,000 had been accepted through the clearing system - a rise of six per cent on last year which was itself a record.  In addition, 5,020 of these were late applicants - meaning they could have decided to change their minds after Chancellor George Osborne’s budget decision to scrap maintenance grants.  The rise in student numbers will fuel concerns that growing numbers will be unable to repay their loans if growing numbers are recruited into lower paid jobs. At present, they only have to pay once they are earning £21,000 a year and the debt is written off after 30 years.  “This situation is unsustainable given that the Government estimates that 45 per cent of university graduates will not earn enough to repay their student loans,” said Mr Cheese. The figure is the estimate being worked on by the Government.  “Efforts need to be redoubled to ensure young people who are making choices after receiving their GCSE and A-level results can access good quality careers information, advice and guidance so they can make better informed decisions,” he added.  The report also coincides with further research published this morning showing a dire shortage of apprentices in the UK building industry with 66 per cent of small construction firms admitting they have been forced to turn down new business because they just do not have the employees to carry it out. Almost half have had to outsource work to other firms rather than leave it unfinished.  Watch more  The research by the Federation of Master Builders blames pressure being put on teenagers to stay in full-time education and influence from teachers and family friends to pursue more academic goals.  The CIPD report, which is published the day before more than half a million teenagers received their GCSE results, calls on ministers to raise their efforts to increase the quality and quantity of apprenticeships to plug the skill shortage gaps. It urges employers to review recruitment practices to avoid using degrees as a screening process for jobs who do not require a university education.  Thursday is expected to see little change in the pass rate of 98.5 per cent and the 68.8 per cent getting five or more top grade A* to C grade passes last year. Exams regulator Ofqual has already indicated there will be a further drift in the numbers taking core academic subjects such as maths, English, the sciences, history and geography. The numbers taking modern foreign languages is expected to remain about the same.  A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: “We are providing the right mix of university places and apprenticeships to ensure more people have the opportunity to advance their careers and businesses get the skills they need to grow.  “Demands for higher education remains strong and graduates enjoy a pay premium that reflects their value to employers.”  Case study  Will Swarbrick, 21, enjoyed a distinguished academic career at the University of Warwick graduating in the summer of this year with a First Class history degree.  Will Swarbrick secured a job in the technology sector after completing a history degree  In spite of this academic success he, like many of his counterparts, has entered into employment in an entirely unrelated sector.  Will secured a job just after graduation in the technology sector.  He now works for the games development company Exient, based in Leamington Spa, where he confesses that he rarely uses his degree.  “Unfortunately other than very general, transferable skills my degree hasn’t really come into play in my current job,” he said.  “Although I enjoyed studying history, in reality its practical use is almost non-existent in my current role.”  No longer concerned with Marx and Foucault, Will now spends his days thinking about console, handheld and mobile game development.  Does he feel the degree provided good value for money?  “Not yet, but maybe at some point in the longer term.”  He does not regret his choice to study history but is now more mindful of the non-academic aspects of university education like extra-curricular activities and employer networking.  He wishes that his university had provided more hands-on, practical employment support and says that such support was insufficient while he was an undergraduate.  “The university tried their best with emails and occasional talks, but real-world experience could have been better.”  He suggests that universities could have built employability sessions into the curriculum from the beginning of the degree course and could have made access to employer information more readily available.  He advises future graduates to put more emphasis on part-time work and work experience to build a successful CV.  “I had a job while studying for my degree and I’m sure this has helped me secure my current employment.”  Harvey Day",partial
b0ba5e99,"Britain picks up £36m bill for closure of the Calais 'Jungle' camp Britain is footing a £36million bill for the closure of the Jungle migrant camp in Calais.  Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the UK would help pay for the evacuation that began on Monday and for measures to keep the site shut.  The UK has already pledged £80million to pay private security firms to patrol ports in northern France for three years.  Scroll down for video  More than 2,000 migrants were moved from the Jungle on Monday but many more remain pictured and there are fears a hardcore will refuse to budge  And a few weeks ago the British government agreed to fund the £2million ‘Great Wall of Calais’ to stop stowaways sneaking across the Channel.  It means British taxpayers face a total bill of £118million to secure the Jungle site and the French ports over the next three years, despite charities warning many migrants will inevitably return.  The frontrunner for the French presidential elections, Alain Juppé, has also threatened to tear up the Le Touquet deal that allows Britain to carry out border checks in France.  Amber Rudd left is willing to give France £118 million to help clear up the migrant mess and secure borders but Alain Juppé right, with a supporter wants to remove Britain's right to carry out border checks on the French side of the border  French authorities finally began evacuating the makeshift Jungle camp ahead of its demolition, which was due to start today.  The first 2,000 migrants were evacuated to temporary accommodation centres around France.  But in a series of developments:  Charities warned thousands more migrants could refuse to leave over the coming days because of their desperation to reach Britain;  Hundreds gathered in protests, chanting ‘UK, UK, UK,’ and vowed to build a new Jungle;  Others vowed they would return to Calais if relocated, and step up illegal efforts to cross the Channel;  British police joined the search to identify up to 200 British anarchists intent on fuelling protests at the camp;  Up to 70 young male refugees arrived at a 17th Century manor house in Devon;  France asked Britain to temporarily suspend the transfer of child refugees.  In an urgent statement to the Commons Miss Rudd said responsibility for Calais rested with the French government, but insisted border controls between the two countries were vital to Britain’s security.  She said: ‘The UK Government will be contributing up to £36m to maintain the security of these controls, to support the camp clearance and to ensure in the long term that the camp is kept closed. This funding will also be used to help keep children safe in France.  A young migrant cycles through the remains of the camp on Monday night. Most of those still inside the Jungle are young men, mostly from Africa  ‘This contribution is not made unconditionally, and we will continue to work with the French Government to ensure that the clearance operation is full and lasting.’  The Home Secretary said British officials were only given access to the camp to begin interviewing children last week.  Britain could not begin transferring unaccompanied children until it had permission from France, which was only given recently, she said.  But in Calais, migrants said they would build a new Jungle as buses began taking hundreds of mainly Sudanese and Eritrean men to temporary accommodation centres around France.  A migrant from Ethiopia's persecuted Oromo tribe hugs a friend as he leaves the Jungle today  Many left willingly but others said they would ‘rather die’ than give up on their dreams of reaching the UK.  Scuffles broke out as a poorly-managed crowd of migrants was penned together by French riot police while they waited to be processed.  As dusk fell, protests were held by those unwilling to leave, who chanted ‘UK, UK, UK!’ and fires raged in the camp amid claims that migrants had torched an area used as a base by British charity workers.  Riot police were on standby amid fears up to 200 anarchists from the British group No Borders had infiltrated the camp over the weekend and were intent on violence.  A 16-year-old migrant from Ethiopia cries as he waits to register at a processing centre in the the Jungle near Calais  A helicopter flew overhead and two specialist ‘spotter’ officers from the Metropolitan Police joined their French counterparts to help search for suspects.  Many migrants told the Daily Mail the closure of the camp meant they would step up efforts to cross the Channel by any means necessary.  Imran Ali, 20, from Afghanistan, said: ‘We must get to the UK. If I die it’s no problem. I would rather die than stay here. In France they don’t like refugees. They treat refugees like dogs.’  Another man fleeing Afghanistan admitted several of his friends in their 20s had tried to register as children in a bid to reach Britain.  The migrants were registered before getting onto buses which took them from Calais to reception centres the length and breadth of France  His admission follows widespread concern that some of the ‘child’ refugees brought to Britain appeared to be far older than 18.  In Calais four men were spotted attempting to board a British-registered lorry as it halted at traffic lights in the town centre.  Christian Salome, president of the French charity Auberge des Migrants, said he expected 2,000 people in the Jungle to refuse to leave.  He told French newspaper La Voix du Nord: ‘They still want to get to England.  'If the evacuations have been calm on Monday, you have to be far more careful in the coming days when the only ones left are the ones who don’t want to leave, and are adamant that they are going to keep trying to get to England.’  Many migrants are still determined to get into Britain by hook or by crook  French authorities admitted those willing to leave had been delayed by a lack of buses, and one accommodation centre in Loubeyrat, central France, was set alight just hours before the migrants were due to arrive.  The Home Office said it had temporarily suspended transferring child refugees from the camp to Britain at the request of the French.  Labour MP Luciana Berger said social workers working in the UK had described a ‘bureaucratic shambles’, with wrong names and addresses given out and the wrong forms submitted.  The Home Secretary told the Commons there were 36 British officials working to find and prioritise the youngest and most vulnerable children and Britain had a ‘moral responsibility’ to help.  She said British officials have interviewed around 800 children in the Jungle and almost 200 have been brought to the UK so far, including 60 girls said to be at high risk of sexual exploitation.  Charities estimate more than 1,000 children could still be inside, including 49 unaccompanied children aged under 13, and three under 11, and warned they remained at risk of trafficking and abuse.  The Home Secretary said several hundred more children would arrive in Britain in the next few weeks, but new children who arrived in Calais after the Jungle was cleared would not be accepted in this country.  England Test star of the future? Migrants play cricket in the camp just before dusk on Monday  French newspaper Le Figaro said around 500 unaccompanied children in Calais were claiming to have family in the UK, meaning they were eligible to come here.  Miss Rudd said 800 had been interviewed and 200 had been transferred to Britain, with several hundred more expected to follow in the next few weeks.  She said children accepted as unaccompanied refugees would not be allowed to ‘sponsor’ their parents to come and join them in the UK.  Conservatives called for Britain to step up its border security to prevent migrants making last-ditch attempts to make their way across the Channel.  Charlie Elphicke, MP for Dover in Kent, said: ‘People will be more desperate than ever to see if they can break into Britain.’",fake
856e15b2,"Deaths in police custody at highest level for five years The number of people dying in police custody has reached its highest level for five years, according to the latest figures released hours before the home secretary launches an independent review following decades of pressure from families who have lost loved ones.  The new statistics from the Independent Police Complaints Commission IPCC say 17 people died in or following detention by the police in 2014-15 – six more than during the previous year.  15 of 17 who died in custody were white,1 Asian and 1 black person; Dead include 14 men & 3 women, ages ranged from 22 to 57 years, say IPCC — vikram dodd @VikramDodd July 23, 2015  The last time the figure was higher was in 2010-11 when it stood at 21. The IPCCalso revealed that there were 69 apparent suicides following custody. This is 50% higher than the 46 people in 2010-11.  On Thursday afternoon Theresa May will launch an independent review of deaths in police custody and promise to stamp out the “evasiveness and obstruction” suffered by families at the hands of the authorities. The home secretary aims to transform public confidence in the police, declaring that she has been “been struck by the pain and suffering of families still looking for answers”.  The speech, to be given in south London, is expected to touch on some of the most emotive issues in the police’s relationship with the communities it serves and follows five years of barely concealed running warfare between ministers and the police under the Conservative-led coalition.    The invite for selected guests to attend on Thursday afternoon hails the significance of May’s speech. It reads: “The home secretary will set out the government’s reforms to transform the relationship between the public and the police and to preserve the historic principle that the public are the police and the police are the public.”  We have published the statistics for deaths during or following police contact in 2014/15 http://t.co/CYCLHjmAyU pic.twitter.com/S1JYA2Vc2w — IPCC @IPCCNews July 23, 2015  May will return to a subject she focused on in an uncompromising 2014 speech to the conference of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers. She warned then that abuses by officers had jeopardised the bedrock of British law enforcement – policing by consent of the public.    Families and those who have helped their battles for justice said they wanted to learn the full details of the government’s plans before giving their blessing.    In extracts released in advance by her officials, May says: “In my time as home secretary, I have been struck by the pain and suffering of families still looking for answers, who have encountered not compassion and redress from the authorities, but what they feel as evasiveness and obstruction.  “I have also heard first-hand the frustration of police officers and staff, whose mission it is to help people but whose training and procedures can end up causing bureaucracy and delay.  “No one – least of all police officers – wants such incidents to happen, and I know everyone involved takes steps to avoid them. But when such incidents do occur, every single one represents a failure – and has the potential to undermine dramatically the relationship between the public and the police.”  The review of deaths in custody will investigate the restraint methods used by officers and how incidents are investigated, following sustained criticism of the IPCC from families.  It will also examine how to provide alternative places for people with mental health problems, so they do not end up in a police cell with officers acting as a service of last resort because there is no other service available.  In April, the Guardian revealed that the home secretary had held several meetings with the families of two men who died in custody – Sean Rigg and Olaseni Lewis – and wrote to them to say how moved she was by their suffering, which was made worse by the failings of the criminal justice system. Rigg and Lewis died after restraint by officers in 2008 and 2010 respectively. Their families are yet to receive full answers and the final resolution they want despite years of legal action.    The home secretary, Theresa May. Photograph: Rex Shutterstock  Ajibola Lewis, the mother of Olaseni Lewis, said families such as hers should have been consulted by the home secretary about what the review should examine and it was too early to tell if it was a public relations exercise or meaningful: “We are surprised that the proposed review, its purpose and its scope is being announced without any prior consultation with us or other families in our position.”    Lewis added: “We find deep-seated and repeated failures on the part of all of the agencies of the state to whom we look to take responsibility to investigate and prevent such deaths, including those concerned within the senior management of our police service, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, the Crown Prosecution Service and the coroner’s courts.”    Marcia Rigg-Samuel said of the proposed review: “There is a clear need for a radical overhaul of how the whole system works following a death in police custody, and I hope that the independent review will address this, as well as the root causes of these avoidable deaths and ensuring accountability for those who fail in their duties to members of the public.”  The latest official statistics show that in 2013-14, 68 people took their own lives within two days of being arrested or detained, the highest figure for a decade. There were also 11 deaths during or after police custody. May will say: “All too often vulnerable people, often those with mental health problems, are taken because there is no other place to go.”  It is also expected that May will promise to make the police more diverse because police officers are currently more white than the communities they serve.    The speech follows a raft of announcements on key policy areas from the new Conservative government, showing that despite only having a small majority, it will not shy away from pursuing its agenda, which it says is reformist and radical, while critics dismiss it as dogmatic and divisive.  Now elected with a parliamentary majority and armed with a fresh electoral mandate, the Conservatives seem set to take on the police service between now and 2020. Ministers will say they are necessary reforms, while some in policing will see it as a continuation of bashing a service already diminished and demoralised by the past five years, which have seen large budget cuts.  The home secretary is threatening police with legislation over their use of stop and search powers if they do not demonstrate that they are voluntarily stamping out the excessive targeting of black people and other minority groups.  As part of the drive to professionalise the police, the government pressed for a College of Policing to be founded, which it was in 2012. Its chief executive officer, Alex Marshall, said: “Police officers and custody staff do a difficult job dealing with detained individuals who may be aggressive and abusive. However, policing is often seen as a service of last resort, and officers often come into contact with people in a vulnerable state.    “While we have seen significant improvement in this area over the past decade, much remains to be done to improve cross-sector work. It is vital that health and social services recognise their role to help prevent the tragic loss to the families involved.”  Deborah Coles, of Inquest, which supports those who have lost loved ones during detention or contact with state agencies, said: “It is too early to tell if this is more about a public relations exercise than a real attempt to bring about effective systemic change and the necessary accountability of police officers.”",partial
688adf93,"Brexit: Number of Britons getting EU citizenship of another country doubles The number of Britons taking up EU citizenship of another member state more than doubled in the year of the Brexit referendum, official EU figures show.  Eurostat, the EU’s statistics agency, shows that 6,555 British nationals acquired such citizenship in 2016, up from 2,478 in 2015.  Germany was the biggest country for Britons to adopt the citizenship of, with 2,702. France and Belgium followed with 517 and 506 citizens each.  Other​ significant beneficiaries of British citizens were Cyprus, Ireland and Italy.  “We are seeing a Brexodus of people giving up their passports and rushing to take citizenship in EU countries as Brexit draws near,” Paul Butters, a spokesperson for the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said.  “People have done this to give themselves some security. This should make David Davis ashamed that people feel they have no option but to give up their citizenship or apply to be a dual national. These people are giving up part of their identity to try to secure their future.  “The government don’t seem to care and their only interest is their ill advised ‘tens of thousands’ immigration target.  “The government dragged their feet over EU citizens’ rights and this is the real life manifestation of their tactics.

One possible post-Brexit immigration scheme could struggle to channel workers towards less attractive roles - while another may heighten the risk of labour exploitation, a new report warns. PA The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Customs union A key point in the negotiations remains Britain's access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does? No 10 has so far insisted that “Brexit means Brexit” and that Britain will be leaving the customs union, but may be inclined to change its position once the potential risks to the UK’s economic outlook become clearer. Alamy The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Northern Ireland-Irish border Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. To ensure borderless travel on the island, the countries must be in regulatory alignment and therefore adhere to the same rules as the customs union. In December, the Conservative Party’s coalition partners, the DUP, refused a draft agreement that would place the UK/EU border in the Irish Sea due to its potential to undermine the union. May has promised that would not be the case and has suggested that a “specific solution” would need to be found. Getty The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Transition period Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit. The talks, however, have reached an impasse. Though May has agreed that the UK will continue to contribute to the EU budget until 2021, the PM wants to be able to select which laws made during this time the UK will have to adhere to. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said the UK must adopt all of the laws passed during the transition, without any input from British ministers or MEPs. EPA The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Rights of EU citizens living the UK The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear. May insists that those who arrive during the transition period should not be allowed to stay, whereas the EU believe the cut-off point should be later. Getty The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Future trade agreement with the EU Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU. Infighting within the Cabinet has prevented a solid position from being reached, with some MPs content that no deal is better than a bad deal while others rally behind single market access. The EU has already confirmed that access to the single market would be impossible without the UK remaining in the customs union. Getty The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Future trade agreements internationally The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London. However the UK cannot make trade agreements with another country while it is still a member of the EU, and the potential loss of trade with the world's major powers is a source of anxiety for the PM. The EU has said the UK cannot secure trade deals during the transition period. EPA The biggest issues facing UK on leaving EU Financial services Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal. However according to new reports Germany has suggested allowing trade on the condition that the UK continues paying into the EU budget even after the transition period.

The department in Dublin said more than 779,000 of the Republic’s passports were issued in 2017, a record figure, with 81,752 Irish citizens in Northern Ireland being among those who received passports.  The European parliament has repeatedly called in its resolutions for exploration of some mechanism by which British people can opt-in to keep their EU citizenship, but little actual movement has been made on this so far in talks – with such a system looking increasingly unlikely.",truth
14010ae5,"Court of appeal rules that ‘bedroom tax’ is unlawful Today, the Court of Appeal has ruled that the so-called ‘bedroom tax’ is unlawful because of its impact on vulnerable individuals. The Court of Appeal dealt with two appeals together and in both cases ruled that the discrimination against victims of domestic violence and disabled children was not lawful.  One appeal, brought by a woman known only as ‘A,’ concerned the effect of the policy on women living in ‘Sanctuary Scheme’ homes – properties which are specially adapted because of risks to the lives and physical safety of women and children who live in them. The second appeal, brought by Paul and Susan Rutherford and their grandson Warren, concerns the impact of the policy on seriously disabled children who need overnight care. In both appeals, the judges accepted that the bedroom tax policy unlawfully discriminates – against women and domestic violence victims, and against seriously disabled children requiring overnight care.  A’s Appeal  This appeal is brought by a woman known only as ‘A’ because her identity must be protected for her own safety. She is a victim of rape, assault, harassment and stalking at the hands of an ex-partner. She challenges the under-occupation provisions/ size criteria, colloquially known as the ‘bedroom tax’. She claims that the housing benefit regulations which have introduced the scheme are discriminatory and will have devastating consequences for her and her 11-year-old son.  Under the ‘bedroom tax’, A and her son are only entitled to receive housing benefit for a 2-bedroom property. However they live in a 3-bedroom property which has been specially adapted for them by the police pursuant to a Sanctuary Scheme, because her life and physical safety are at risk from her ex-partner who has a history of serious violence. Her housing benefit has been reduced by 14% given the Secretary of State’s policy.  The Sanctuary Scheme aims to enable householders at risk of violence to remain safely in their own home by installing a ‘Sanctuary’ within the home and provide support to the household. A has had a ‘panic space’ installed in her home, as well as a specialist ‘sanctuary system’. This includes expensive reinforced doors, electric alarms, a marker on the house and alarms linked to the police station.  Her legal team solicitor Rebekah Carrier at Hopkin Murray Beskine and barristers Karon Monaghan QC, Matrix Chambers, and Caoilfhionn Gallagher and Katie O’Byrne, Doughty Street Chambers argued that the Secretary of State had failed to take into account the disproportionate impact of the ‘bedroom tax’ upon victims of domestic violence, who are overwhelmingly women, and in particular those in Sanctuary Scheme homes.  According to figures obtained in freedom of information responses from 79 local authorities, almost 1 in 20 households using the Sanctuary Scheme for people at risk of severe domestic violence have been affected by the under-occupancy penalty or bedroom tax, totalling 281 households across the country. The vast majority of people in the Sanctuary Scheme are women.  Rebekah Carrier, the solicitor acting for A, said:  “These changes to housing benefit have had a catastrophic impact upon vulnerable people across the country. Our client’s life is at risk and she is terrified. The anxiety caused by the bedroom tax and the uncertainty about this case has been huge. She lives in a property which has been specially adapted by the police, at great expense, to protect her and her child. The prospect of having to move to another property where she will not have any of these protections or take in a lodger has loomed large for her during the three years it has taken this case to come to the Court of Appeal. She is a vulnerable single parent who has been a victim of rape and assault. She is delighted that the Court of Appeal has recognised the impact that the bedroom tax is having on her and others like her. She very much hopes that the Secretary of State will now see sense and agree to change the rules to protect the small but extremely vulnerable class of women and children who need the safety of a sanctuary scheme whilst they try to rebuild their lives after surviving domestic violence.  “An investment has been made in keeping these vulnerable women safe and to move families in these circumstances out of their homes is a false economy as it will cost further money to provide security at the new property, and this may provide a reduced level of safety, putting them at risk. It is important to remember that on average two women every week are killed by a current or former partner in England and Wales – protecting abused women and their children is a matter of life and death, and we should always remember this.”  A’s claim is supported by evidence from the charity Women’s Aid on the prevalence of domestic violence and on the important function of Sanctuary Schemes in providing protection and preventing homelessness for those at risk.  The Rutherford Appeal  Paul and Susan Rutherford care for their severely disabled grandson, Warren, in a special-adapted three bedroom bungalow in Pembrokeshire. Warren has a rare genetic disorder, Potokoi-Shaffer Syndrome, and is unable to walk, talk or feed himself and requires24 hour care. In the judgement handed down today, the Court found that the ‘bedroom tax’ discriminates against disabled children in breach of the Human Rights Act.  Both Paul and Susan have disabilities themselves and can only care for Warren with the help of paid carers who stay overnight on a regular basis. The couple was hit by the bedroom tax for their third bedroom which they need for the carers to stay in overnight and for storing disability equipment for Warren. The current regulations allow for an additional bedroom if a disabled adult requires overnight care but not for a disabled child in the same situation. The Court found that this unlawfully discriminates against disabled children and cannot be justified.  The family had launched a judicial review challenging the ‘bedroom tax’ which reduces housing benefit payments to tenants deemed to be under-occupying their accommodation. They have been receiving discretionary payments from the local authority to cover the shortfall in rent but the Court found this policy was not adequate as there is no guarantee it would continue to be available to them in the future.  Lord Thomas CJ found that the failure of the Secretary of State to make provision in the regulations for overnight carers of disabled children amounted to unlawful discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It was “very difficult to justify the treatment within the same regulation of carers for disabled children and disabled adults, where precisely the opposite result is achieved: provision for the carers of disabled adults but not for the carers of disabled children.” The Secretary of State had also failed to have regard to the best interests of disabled children when devising the regulations.  Mike Spencer, solicitor at the Child Poverty Action Group, who acts for the Rutherfords, said,  ‘We are delighted that disabled children will finally be entitled to the same treatment as disabled adults. It is absurd to have a situation where children like Warren might have to go into residential care at vast cost to the taxpayer because their families cannot pay for the housing they need. Instead of putting this family through the ordeal of a further appeal, the Government should now think seriously about amending the regulations to protect severely disabled children.’  NOTES FOR EDITORS:",fake
5d57071e,"Policing meltdown: 1,012 rapists and 343 killers on run Chris Guest More pictured became one of the UK’s most wanted criminals after he fled to Spain following the shocking torture and murder of Brian Waters in June 2003  Tens of thousands of crime suspects are on the loose because of the ‘near perilous’ state of policing.  The official watchdog says many cases are being shelved without proper investigation, emergency calls downgraded and victims left in danger.  Almost 46,000 suspects are now on the police wanted database including 343 sought for murder or manslaughter and 1,012 for rape.  The hard-hitting report from HM Inspectorate of Constabulary accused the 43 forces of England and Wales of failing the public.  Zoe Billingham, who heads the watchdog, said: ‘We are leading to a very serious conclusion regarding the potentially perilous state of British policing in this report. We are raising a red flag: it is a large red flag.’  Her inspection concluded that:  A shortage of detectives and investigators amounted to a ‘national crisis’;  Constabularies wrote off too many domestic abuse cases;  2,700 sex offenders had not been fully assessed for the risk they posed to the public;  Only 19 per cent of the public had seen a beat bobby in the past month as the decline of community policing continued;  Gangs of dangerous criminals were not being formally classified and monitored.  Police unions blamed crippling cuts to budgets as part of the national austerity drive.  Since 2009 – the year before the Tory-led coalition came to power – forces have lost around 21,500 officers. Miss Billingham said the issues facing the police were not solely down to the budget cuts imposed by the Government.  Twenty per cent of the 45,960 wanted suspects on the database were being sought for theft and one in eight for violence. Other main categories included terrorism and firearms offences.  HMIC said it had serious concerns that forces were taking ‘insufficient action’ to actively find suspects. It added: ‘Too often suspects wanted in connection with crimes are not being tracked down relentlessly.’  Among those who have fled justice is a man alleged to have shot dead a teenager and then a mother of three 12 months later.  THE FUGITIVES WHO ARE WANTED FOR RAPE AND MURDER Chris Guest More MURDER Chris Guest More, 39, became one of the UK’s most wanted criminals after he fled to Spain following the shocking torture and murder of Brian Waters in June 2003. Three men were jailed but More has never been found after fleeing 36 hours after the attack in Tabley, Cheshire. His millionaire father Christopher was jailed for nine months in 2004 for assisting an offender after visiting his son in Malaga with cash and clothes. David Ungi MURDER David Ungi, 24, is thought to be in the Netherlands after fleeing Britain 18 hours after the 2015 drive-by shooting of Vinny Waddington, 18, in Liverpool. Arif Chowdhury CHILD ABUSE Arif Chowdhury, 20, the suspected ringleader of a gang who allegedly raped a girl of 13, fled after he was freed on bail. Police believe he is hiding in Bangladesh. Kevin Thomas Parle MURDER Kevin Thomas Parle, 36, fled Liverpool after the shooting of Liam Kelly, 16, in 2004. A year later he became a suspect in the killing of mother Lucy Hargreaves. Sultan Amari RAPE Syrian migrant Sultan Amari, 46, fled to Turkey during his trial last year for raping a university student in Chester. He was given 11 years’ jail in his absence. Costas Sampson RAPE Costas Sampson, 26, a Greek Cypriot, fled the country on the day he was due to stand trial for the rape of a girl he met in a London nightclub in 2010. Advertisement  Others on the run include a Syrian migrant rapist who fled to Turkey half way through his trial last year. HMIC found that the details of at least 67,000 people suspected of committing offences were not on the database – if stopped in another part of the country it would not flag up that they were wanted.  Inspectors said the public was being left at ‘unacceptable risk’ because some hard-pressed forces were downgrading emergency calls. This meant officers would be permitted to respond to a call within an hour, instead of the standard 15 minutes.  Another tactic was that of failing to send officers to domestic abuse incidents. The 128-page report said the ‘unwelcome practices’ had the effect of ‘artificially suppressing the demand for the police to take prompt and effective action’. The watchdog said this was a form of rationing of police services.  One in five investigations were never taken further because the victim ‘did not support police action’. In domestic abuse cases, this rose to a third. Inspectors said some forces were using this option to close investigations prematurely.  The report said: ‘Overuse of this outcome is likely to mean that far too many perpetrators of extremely harmful domestic abuse crimes are not being brought to justice and victims are being failed by the police.’  Miss Billingham said: ‘We have seen how some forces are attempting to reduce pressure on their teams by artificially suppressing or downgrading calls upon their service, reducing their ability to take the most effective and prompt action. This is often an unintended consequence of recent changes forces have made, frequently in response to the challenge of austerity, and as they struggle to respond to increasing and ever changing levels of demand.  ‘Consequently, some basic things are not being done. We found evidence of fewer arrests being made, some crimes are being shelved without proper investigations and suspects are not always being relentlessly tracked down.’  Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Brian Paddick, a former senior police officer, said: ‘It is totally unacceptable that police officers, who are doing more than anyone can reasonably expect of them, are being forced to downgrade “life at risk” calls.  ‘How long before someone dies because there is no police officer to respond? The police are not doing enough to keep us safe from some of the most dangerous criminals. Hundreds of killers and rapists are not being kept under control. These people should not be on our streets.’  Lucy Hastings, of the charity Victim Support, said victims were being let down.  Overall, one force was judged to be outstanding, 28 were good, 13 required improvement and one was rated inadequate. Michael Barton, the National Police Chiefs’ Council spokesman for crime operations, said it was disappointing that HMIC had concerns that some forces were falling short.  He blamed budget reductions and the loss of thousands of officers and staff, adding: ‘It’s a simple reality that we are required to prioritise more.’  Steve White of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said: ‘What we are seeing is a service that is only being driven by cost constraints and some areas of policing are on the critical list and heading towards intensive care.’  Brandon Lewis, the Minister for Policing and the Fire Service, said: 'I am pleased that two-thirds of forces are rated in today’s report as either good or outstanding.  'But a number clearly still have to do more to deliver the services communities expect and deserve. Those identified as inadequate or requiring improvement must take urgent action.  'I am also concerned by HMIC's findings over wanted suspects not being recorded on the Police National Computer. Police chiefs must respond swiftly and decisively to HMIC’s recommendation, to ensure this unacceptable situation is rectified.'",partial
6ffa74c1,"Four out of five migrants are NOT from Syria: EU figures expose the 'lie' Only one in every five migrants claiming asylum in Europe is from Syria.  The EU logged 213,000 arrivals in April, May and June but only 44,000 of them were fleeing the Syrian civil war.  Campaigners and left-wing MPs have suggested the vast majority of migrants are from the war-torn state, accusing the Government of doing too little to help them.  'This exposes the lie peddled in some quarters that vast numbers of those reaching Europe are from Syria,' said David Davies, Tory MP for Monmouth. 'Most people who are escaping the war will go to camps in Lebanon or Jordan.  'Many of those who have opted to risk their lives to come to Europe have done so for economic reasons.'  Hungary has announced plans to build a giant fence along the Croatian border - just days after sealing off access from Serbia with a 100 mile razor-wire barrier pictured  One man lifts a crying baby as he waits to board a bus heading for a reception centre for migrants in Croatia's capital of Zagreb  Sir Bill Cash, a fellow Tory, said: 'These figures make extremely disturbing reading. The whole argument has been made that this influx is all real refugees from Syria whereas this adds to the substantial evidence that there are a large number of economic migrants who are aiming for a better life.'  The figures from Eurostat, the EU's official statistical agency, show that migration from April to June was running at double the level of the same period in 2014.  The number of Afghans lodging asylum claims is up four-fold, from 6,300 to 27,000. Another 17,700 claims were made by Albanians, whose country is at peace.  A further 13,900 applicants came from Iraq which, like Syria, is being torn apart by the Islamic State terror group.  This exposes the lie peddled in some quarters that vast numbers of those reaching Europe are from Syria. David Davies, Tory MP for Monmouth  Half a million migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, with 156,000 coming in August alone. Rather than claiming asylum in the first safe EU country they reach, most head on toward wealthy northern states. The human cost of the crisis has been paid by the estimated 3,000 migrants who have drowned after putting their lives in the hands of people smugglers for the perilous crossing of the Mediterranean.  Risks being taken by many families were highlighted by the deaths of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi and his brother Galip, five, whose bodies were washed up on the tourist beach of Bodrum in Turkey earlier this month.  More than 250,000 migrants have reached Greece and Italy, where the authorities are close to breaking point.  Struggling to cope: Croatia's Prime Minister said today that his country will redirect migrants to Hungary and Slovenia  Police officers watch on as migrants sit on the windows of a train at a railway station near the Slovenian-Croatian border in Dobova, Brezice  Refugees are making increasingly desperate attempts to cross Europe. A group of migrants are pictured trying to cross the river Sutla near Senkovec, Croatia on their way to Slovenia  DAILY MAIL COMMENT TO listen to the BBC, you might believe that every one of the hundreds of thousands of migrants clamouring to get into the EU was a Syrian refugee fleeing the horror of Islamic State or tyrannical president Bashar al-Assad. But new Eurostat figures show the truth: 80 per cent are from as far afield as Pakistan, Nigeria and Albania - many of them economic migrants simply looking for a better life. The Mail does not underestimate the agony and desperation of genuine Syrian asylum seekers who, of course, deserve care and compassion. That’s why David Cameron was right to ensure that those granted refuge in Britain come from camps on the Syrian border, rather than from among those already in Europe – who may not be Syrian. But Germany – by first extending a welcome to all migrants, then slamming its borders shut when overwhelming numbers responded to the invitation – has created chaos for all its neighbours, where untold numbers are now stranded. Through her naive and muddled policy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has placed the very future of the EU in jeopardy. Advertisement  German Chancellor Angela Merkel fuelled the chaos last month by declaring that any Syrian who reached the country could claim asylum.  When the numbers became uncontrollable Berlin shut its borders, throwing Austria, Hungary and other EU countries into turmoil.  Croatia has received 14,000 migrants in the past two days and was last night moving some to the Hungarian border.  Hungary is laying razor wire on the border having done the same on its border with Serbia.  Croatia has closed seven of eight road crossings to Serbia and ordered its border guards to redirect migrants to Hungary and Slovenia. The Hungarian government described this as 'totally unacceptable'.  Violence broke out yesterday between Syrian and Afghan migrants fighting to board trains across Croatia.  And Slovenian riot police last night stood in the path of 200 migrants trying to enter from Croatia. Slovenian ministers say they will accept asylum seekers but send back anyone deemed to be an illegal immigrant.  Britain, which received 7,470 asylum applications between April and June, has come under fire for failing to join an EU scheme to spread 160,000 migrants between the 28 member states.  A man uses crutches as he joins other migrants crossing the border between Greece and Macedonia near the city of Gevgelija, Macedonia  Refugees sit under a bridge at the border between Austria and Germany, in Freilassing, southern Germany this morning  GERMANY COULD SPEND UP TO €25 BILLION ON MIGRANT INTAKE Germany's lead in housing hundreds of thousands of migrants heading to Europe from a war-torn Middle East could cost its Treasury tens of billions of euros over the next two years, according to early private estimates. The Japanese investment bank Mizuho was one of the first to put a number on it on yesterday, saying that accepting up to one million refugees a year over the next two years could cost Berlin €25 billion euros. That is derived from a basic calculation of €12,500 per migrant, according to Peter Chatwell, senior rates strategist at Mizuho. Part of the extra spending may have to be met by extra borrowing. Over half a dozen banks contacted by Reuters broadly agreed with Mizuho's calculations. Advertisement  David Cameron has announced the UK will shelter 20,000 vulnerable Syrians from camps in Lebanon and Jordan. But he rejected calls to take migrants already in Europe, saying this would encourage more to make the dangerous journey.  Yvette Cooper, who chairs Labour's refugee taskforce, said: 'Britain's approach of only planning to take refugees from the camps in Syria isn't working.  'It ignores the crisis also happening in Europe itself and means Britain has no leverage to get other countries to sign up to help.'  But a Home Office spokesman said: 'Claiming asylum must not be viewed as an easy means of settlement by those who are not actually refugees.  'We need systems which keep out unfounded claims so we can all respond more quickly and effectively to those genuinely in need of refuge.",partial

Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  Taxpayers will pick up a £2million security bill for Eugenie’s wedding.  The minor royal will get married at the same venue as Harry and Meghan.  Labour’s Chris Williamson said: “It really is an outrage.”  Security expenses for Princess Eugenie’s wedding have more than doubled amid increased terror fears since she announced her engagement in January, sources say.  Extra firearms officers may have to be drafted in when the ninth in line to the throne weds tequila brand ambassador Jack Brooksbank on October 12.  Eugenie, 28, who carries out no royal duties, has nevertheless chosen to marry at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle where Prince Harry wed Meghan in May.  Image: Getty Image: Splash News  Dad Prince Andrew was said to have demanded a similarly glitzy event for his younger daughter with Sarah Ferguson.  A royal source said: “The Duke of York has insisted his daughter’s wedding must be a huge occasion to be remembered and wants everyone to get on board to celebrate the happy couple.”  Despite warnings about the extra security issues it would cause, Eugenie and Jack are determined to enjoy all the pomp of an open-top carriage procession down Windsor High Street.  Image: Splash News  It means dozens of officers must be deployed to search the route in advance.  Drones will also be banned from flying over the castle for the whole weekend.  The same tactics were employed for the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, but Eugenie’s wedding was initially set to cost around £750,000.  The increased expenses are due to officers’ overtime, cancellation of holidays and the need for extra patrols.

She said: “In these times of heightened security risks it is irresponsible for a minor member of the royal family to have a high-profile, very public wedding.  “This may be the time to review the role and cost of minor royals.”  Eugenie and sister Beatrice, 30, said this month they just want to be seen as “real”.  Image: Internet Unknown Image: Splash News  But Chris Williamson, Labour MP for Derby North, said tonight: “It really is an outrage when you’ve got people sleeping rough and gripped by poverty that people are indulging in this conspicuous consumption.  “They are as far as it’s possible to be from being real normal people. No one else gets their wedding paid for by the public purse and they’ve got the resources to do it themselves.”  Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel Play now  Police sources say there is no intelligence of any threat or sign of any serious anti-monarchy protests, but nothing will be left to chance.  The huge security operation will be managed by the Met, Thames Valley and British Transport Police.  But amid heightened terror fears in London after this week’s Westminster attack, other forces are understood to have been asked to potentially help out as other teams are needed in the capital.  Image: Splash News Image: Reuters  Eugenie and Jack, 32, who is UK representative for George Clooney’s tequila brand Casamigos, will host 300 guests including dozens of celebrities such as Clooney and his lawyer wife Amal, who were at Harry’s wedding too.  Model Cara Delevingne, actress Suki Waterhouse and supermodels Kate Moss and Cindy Crawford could also attend, alongside singers James Blunt and Ellie Goulding, and pop star Robbie Williams and wife Ayda Field, whose daughter Theodora Rose will be a flower girl.  Beatrice will be maid of honour and Prince William’s children George, five, and Charlotte, three, are expected to be a page boy and flower girl.  Image: Getty  Invitations have also been extended to 1,200 members of the public who will watch the event outside via a live feed.  Eugenie’s cousin Zara, also one of the Queen’s grandchildren, wed ex-England rugby captain Mike Tindall in a small ceremony in Edinburgh in 2011.  Jack’s and Eugenie’s parents will pay for the wedding and reception. A royal spokesman said: “Costs for security will be shared by individual police forces and the local council but all other costs for the wedding will be met privately.”  Wedding list Princess Eugenie Victoria Helena of York is her full title.  She is the Queen’s sixth grandchild while currently ninth in the line of succession.  Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank have been together for 7 years.  The couple are blood relatives. The Duchess of York is the great-great-granddaughter of Lady Julia Coke, who is the daughter of Jack’s great-great-grandfather, Thomas Coke.  There are expected to be 350 guests inside St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, with senior members of the Royal Family including the Queen, and supermodels Cara Delevingne and Cindy Crawford.  Eugenie could opt for British designer Erdem or Vivienne Westwood for her wedding dress.  For: It's right for her to marry at the Castle  Ingrid Seward  Majesty Magazine Editor in chief  Having known Princess Eugenie and her sister Beatrice for many years I can honestly say you could never meet two lovelier, more polite and well-grounded women.  They are a credit to family and friends. They are making their way in the world with successful jobs as well as managing the business of being in a very well-known family.  Image: PA  Eugenie is the Queen’s granddaughter and there is nothing at odds with her getting married at Windsor Castle.  The Queen is expected to attend with almost all other senior members of the Royal Family – and hundreds or thousands of well-wishers – so it stands to reason there will be proper security.  Against: Why all this trouble for a minor royal?  Dai Davies  Ex head of Royal Protection  The fact that the Queen and senior royals will be there is the reason nothing will be left the chance, as well as protecting the crowds.  I think the question should be asked about why is this expense and trouble being afforded to such a minor royal like Princess Eugenie.  Image: PA  Princess Anne’s children have all managed superbly well without any fanfare at all and I can’t imagine many people will be in support of it.  The carriage ride through the streets is a potential problem.  I’m not sure who would have thought this would be a good idea, certainly none of those planning the operation would have encouraged it.",truth
e3cbd113,"EU referendum: Government dossier aims to 'smoke out' Leave campaign The government has published an analysis of the UK's options if it left the EU - suggesting they would all be worse for the economy than staying in.    Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the aim was to smoke out Leave campaigners who had avoided spelling out their vision of a post-EU Britain.    The document says the UK would lose influence and exporters could be hit with damaging tariffs.    But Leave campaigners said the dodgy dossier was misleading.        Follow the latest EU referendum and Prime Ministers's Questions updates      The UK's EU vote: All you need to know    Iain Duncan Smith - one of five cabinet ministers campaigning in favour of a vote to leave the EU - said it misrepresented the Leave case by suggesting Britain could follow the example of other non-EU countries, such as Norway or Switzerland.    He said: The truth is, we won't copy any other country's deal. We will have a settlement on our own terms - and one that will return control of our borders, and money to Britain. That's the safer choice.    He said the government was in denial about the risk of remaining a member of the EU. This dodgy dossier won't fool anyone, he said, adding that the real uncertainty is the future of the EU project.    Cabinet ministers are allowed to campaign freely on either side of the debate, but the official government position is in favour of staying in a reformed EU in the 23 June referendum.  line  Four post exit options  UK and EU flagsimage copyrightReuters        Norway model: Member of European Economic Area, full access to single market, obliged to make a financial contribution and accept majority of EU laws, free movement applies as it does in the EU      Swiss model: Member of the European Free Trade Association but not the European Economic Area, access to EU market governed by series of bilateral agreements, covers some but not all areas of trade, also makes a financial contribution but smaller than Norway's, doesn't have a general duty to apply EU laws but does have to implement some EU regulations to enable trade, free movement applies      Free Trade Agreement: Deal would be negotiated after UK voted to leave, generally mean low tariffs on goods but trade in services is usually more limited, exact obligations would depend on depth of agreement: the more comprehensive, the more co-operation there would be on standards, regulations, etc, no free movement or financial contribution unless they were part of the specific agreement      World Trade Organisation rules: WTO sets rules for international trade that apply to all members, no free movement or financial contribution, no obligation to apply EU laws although traded goods would still have to meet EU standards, some tariffs would be in place on trade with the EU, trade in services would be restricted    line    The document says Norway and Switzerland's trading arrangements outside the EU require them to make financial contributions, accept the EU principle of free movement of people and be subject to other EU laws.    Meanwhile, Switzerland and Canada's arrangements provide only limited access to the single market, it adds.    In a speech in London, Mr Hammond said Britain would be locked in talks with the EU for two years after an exit, while our competitors, including our EU competitors, forge ahead.    He said there was no guarantee the UK could reach a deal within the two year limit, and talks could drag on for many years because there would be no goodwill from member states to help the UK get a deal.    He claimed Leave campaigners had deliberately avoided sketching out what a post-exit trade deal would look like because there were no credible options that come close to the deal we already have on the table that had been negotiated by David Cameron.  media captionCould Norway model work for UK?    Mr Hammond said Leave campaigners should be honest with voters and say they are prepared to sacrifice jobs and growth in order to get a clampdown on migration, in order to stop paying into the EU.    He said he hoped the dossier would force Leave campaigners to put some flesh on the bones of their vision of a post EU Britain.    The official government analysis of UK membership of the EU is required by law under the EU Referendum Act, which paved the way for the in-out referendum on EU membership.  'Analysis flawed'    If Britain votes to leave the EU, it will have to negotiate a new trading relationship with what would then be a 27 member organisation, to allow British firms to sell goods and services to EU countries without being hit by penalties or sparking a trade war.    The government paper runs through examples of other countries, such as Norway, Switzerland and Canada, who have trade deals with the EU without being members - as well as the option of breaking free from the EU altogether and striking deals with individual countries through the World Trade Organisation.    These scenarios have been mentioned by anti-EU campaigners in the past.    Speaking to the BBC, Norway's prime minister, Erna Solberg, said she would like her country to be part of the EU because it lacked influence over important decision making and had basically... left part of our democracy to Europe.    Asked if she thought Britain could retain access to the single market without being subject to free movement of people, she said: To believe you'll get everything you want without giving something back does not happen in any political body.  Vote Leave campaignersimage copyrightGetty Images  image captionFive cabinet ministers, including Mr Duncan Smith, are campaigning against the government in favour of an EU exit    The government paper says they each carry serious risks for business - but Leave campaigners say the analysis is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of a bespoke trade deal between the UK and the EU, with no tariffs or trade barriers.    Gerard Lyons, of investment managers Black Rock and chief economic adviser to London mayor and Leave campaigner Boris Johnson, said it would be a shock for both sides if Britain left but it would be in the EU's interest to reach a trade deal with the UK as it was one of the EU's biggest export markets.    Meanwhile, Lord Lamont has become the latest Conservative grandee to nail his colours to one side or other of the EU debate.    Lord Lamont, who was chancellor in the early 1990s when Britain crashed out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, is calling for Britain to leave, arguing in the Daily Telegraph that the country could succeed economically and would regain control of immigration.

1aff43d1,"Daily Mail campaign to save Britain's high streets after 50,000 retail jobs cut The Mail today launches a campaign to save Britain's high streets – after a staggering 50,000 retail jobs were axed in the first half of this year.  The figures expose the bloodbath up and down the country as hundreds of stores – from major chains to small shops – shut their doors.  Business leaders, shopkeepers and MPs blame punitive business rates that cripple high streets and hand a huge advantage to internet giants.  Today chief executives of some of the country's biggest chains, along with politicians from all parties, demand reform as they warn that sky-high rates are stifling investment and driving long-established companies to the wall.  The Mail is launching a campaign to save Britain's high street after 50,000 retail jobs were axed  Last year shops closed at a rate of 16 every day. Figures compiled by the Press Association show that between January and June this year, 50,000 jobs were either lost or expected to go.  In recent months the trail of destruction has hit household names including House of Fraser – which has put 6,000 jobs under threat – and Poundworld, which plunged into administration endangering a further 5,100.  Toys R Us and Maplin collapsed, while chains such as Prezzo, Byron and Jamie's Italian shut restaurants and culled hundreds of jobs.  Meanwhile, the taxman is raking in more and more from business rates – with a total haul of £30.8 billion predicted this year, up from £29.6 billion last year.  The vast majority comes from major retailers in the heart of towns and cities, while online stores and out-of-town shopping centres pay much less in both rates and corporation tax.  Critics say high business rates which force firms to go bust are self-defeating, as they reduce tax revenues.  Marks & Spencer, which is closing more than 100 stores in the next four years with hundreds of jobs at risk, told the Mail that rising rates were partly to blame for its drastic plans.  Chief executive Steve Rowe said: 'Business rates are an unfair burden of taxation directly contributing to the challenges the high street is facing. The long-term effects of these charges are now a reality.  'Our Covent Garden store faced a rate rise of close to a half a million pounds in the year before it closed, an untenable position for any retailer.  Today chief executives of some of the country's biggest chains, along with politicians from all parties, demand reform as they warn that sky-high rates are stifling investment and driving long-established companies to the wall  'These challenges will continue until the system is reformed to create a level playing field between high street and online retailers.'  Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said: 'UK retail is the most employment-dense sector of the economy, so constantly losing businesses in the way we are will have an economic impact.  'And so if they're not careful the Government risk taking too much out of business rates and then losing in the medium term.'  Labour MP Frank Field, chairman of the Commons work and pensions committee, said: 'The taxation of online retailers and firms which funnel their profits abroad should be changed now.  'A specific sales tax should be put on those firms that compete against the high street and barely pay a penny to the Government. Reform is long overdue.'  Senior Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg said: 'Business rates have not kept up with economic change.  High street shops are penalised while online sellers face lower charges giving them another competitive advantage.'  Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said: 'This is a very important and welcome campaign.  Last year shops closed at a rate of 16 every day. Figures compiled by the Press Association show that between January and June this year, 50,000 jobs were either lost or expected to go  'There must be a level playing field and this campaign would be a significant step to achieving that.'  Business rates are based on the estimated rental value of a property. It means that traditional retailers such as department stores with large premises in town and city centres are hit particularly hard, while newer internet rivals such as Amazon pay far less.  Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said one in five of his organisation's members had thought about closing down or selling up because of the pressure from business rates.  He said: 'Along with spiralling rents, increasing labour costs and weakening consumer demand, rising business rates bills are threatening high streets across the country.  'Business rates are an unfair and regressive tax, which hit firms before they've made their first penny in turnover, let alone profit.'  Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, added: 'The broken business rates system puts pressure on firms of all shapes and sizes, taking no account of economic circumstances or business performance.  'In this climate of sluggish growth and weak investment, a system which saps funds and undermines firms' investment potential is particularly jarring.'  The Institute of Directors and Confederation of British Industry also backed calls for reform.  Business leaders, shopkeepers and MPs blame punitive business rates that cripple high streets and hand a huge advantage to internet giants  Meanwhile, pub and restaurant bosses say rates have made it hard to survive in an industry where profits have always been tight and rising inflation has put them under even more pressure.  Experts say 2018 will go down in history as the 'year of the Company Voluntary Arrangement' – an insolvency procedure used to push through several store closure programmes this year.  Robert Hayton, head of UK business rates at Altus Group, said: 'Business rates are rarely the sole driver for insolvencies but certainly a contributory factor, with bills having risen by more than a fifth through inflation during the seven years before last year's revaluation.  'Add that to the lethal cocktail of other increased operating costs for the national living wage and apprenticeship levy and it creates the perfect storm.'  The Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank says business rates should be torn up and replaced with a new system where the value of the land itself is taxed, rather than the buildings on top of it.  Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: 'Government ministers will weep crocodile tears about the situation, but it is government policy that is partly to blame, given the lamentable failure of the Government to shift the unfair burden of business rates away from hard-pressed high street retailers and find a way of taxing online retailers more effectively.'",partial
a8ecc454,"Barnardo’s declares ‘state of emergency’ as number of children needing foster care during Coronavirus pandemic rises by 44% The number of children needing foster care has risen by 44% during the coronavirus pandemic while the number of people looking to become foster parents plummeted by nearly half compared to the same period last year, according to the UK’s leading children’s charity.  From March 1st - April 23rd 2020, there were 2,349 referrals to Barnardo’s fostering services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a figure which shot up from 1,629 for the same period in 2019. Meanwhile the number of enquiries from people looking to become foster parents for the charity fell from 302 to 161 - a dramatic 47% drop.  Barnardo’s says this has created a ‘state of emergency’ as children who may have experienced abuse and neglect wait for places with loving foster families. Without more potential foster carers coming forward, hundreds of children referred to Barnardo’s will not be placed with a family.  The UK’s leading children’s charity believes that the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown has increased pressure on vulnerable families, with job losses, deepening poverty and worsening mental health all leading to family breakdown. Children have also been in lockdown in homes where domestic abuse and sexual abuse are taking place. These pressures will likely impact more families as the crisis continues.  At the same time Barnardo’s believes that the change in circumstances experienced by many because of COVID-19 and uncertainty about the future has resulted in a drop in enquiries being made to the charity from people looking to foster.  Barnardo’s is calling on people over 21, who have a spare room and the time and commitment to support a child to get in touch and consider fostering a child. Barnardo’s welcomes foster carers from all walks of life, including single people, those from the LGBTQ+ community and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic backgrounds.  The charity also wants to make it clear that foster carers will be supported every step of the way by Barnardo’s, and will also be eligible for financial support including carers’ allowance.  To find out more about fostering with Barnardo’s, go to https://www.barnardos.org.uk/foster or call 07712402312 or 0800 0277 280.  Barnardo’s Chief Executive Javed Khan said:  “The Coronavirus pandemic has hit vulnerable families the hardest, with many reaching crisis point. This has created a state of emergency, as more children than ever need a safe and loving foster family, while fewer adults are coming forward as potential foster carers.  “Barnardo’s has over 100 years’ experience bringing vulnerable children together with loving foster families, who provide the vital love and support children need to thrive. If you become a foster carer with Barnardo’s we will support you every step of the way with training and a dedicated social worker. You’ll also receive financial support, including a carer’s allowance.  “Today, there are hundreds of children who have been referred to Barnardo’s and are waiting to be placed with a foster family. If you’re over 21, have a spare room and the time and commitment to support a child in need, please do consider getting in touch today.”  ENDS  Case study  Nichol Garcia is 50 and has been a full-time foster carer for the past nine years. She lives in Nottingham with her teenage son and three foster children.  Nichol says: “I felt I had space in my heart and life for more children, and after talking to my family and most importantly, my son, I got in touch with Barnardo’s and have not regretted it since. I’ve done so many different things in my life, but foster caring is by far the best thing I’ve ever done.”  Over the past nine years, Nichol and her son have fostered 11 young people, mainly teenagers but also younger children, most of whom have stayed with them for long periods of time.  “I was worried I would feel upset when the children left, as I invest so much into each child, but we keep in touch with all of them as they are a part of our family now and we sometimes meet up too. I am a part of their history and they are a part of mine.”  Nichol acknowledges that fostering has its share of challenges too.  She says: “Sometimes children may have had difficult experiences and need additional support such as therapy to help them make sense of what they’ve been through, and it’s important for foster carers to support them with this. I really fight for all of my foster children and young people to get them what they deserve.”  Nichol believes that the constant support and ongoing training offered by Barnardo’s has enabled her to deal with any difficult periods.  “My social worker from Barnardo’s is like a professional friend,” Nichol says. “I meet with her regularly, but if I ever need any advice or support, day or night, there is always someone there to give me everything I need. There is always lots of different training on offer too, and I go on several courses each year.  “Before you are approved to foster, Barnardo’s does some really intense training to ensure potential foster carers are fully aware of what they may experience. They don’t just have the child’s best interests at heart, but also the foster carer’s too.”  Nichol’s advice to anyone who is considering fostering is this: “If you go into foster caring for the wrong reasons, you won’t last long. It’s not always easy, but it is the most rewarding thing you can ever do. For those who already have their own children and may be worried about whether fostering is the right decision for them, in my experience, by keeping my child involved every step of the way, he loves it just as much as I do and we wouldn’t have it any other way now.  “Some of my favourite times are when we all sit outside together chatting around the log burner and I feel really lucky to have them all and love seeing them so happy.”  Notes to Editors  Data shows the number of fostering referrals and enquiries to Barnardo’s from people looking to become foster carers from March 1 - April 23 in 2019 and 2020 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland only.  About Barnardo’s  Last year around 300,000 children, young people, parents and carers were supported by Barnardo’s through more than 1,000 services across the UK, such as young carers, care leavers, foster carers and adoptive parents, training and skills or parenting classes.

5225b538,"NHS cuts 15,000 beds in six years Hospitals have axed 15,000 beds in just six years, leaving wards at ‘breaking point’, a shock report reveals today.  The dramatic reduction – equivalent to closing 24 hospitals – amounts to a 10 per cent fall in NHS beds at a time when the health service is under unprecedented pressure.  There are now just 129,458 hospital beds available for patients at night, down from 144,455 in 2010/11.  Critics say patients’ safety is at risk and blame the cuts on an NHS obsession with shifting care out of hospitals and ‘closer to home’.  The dramatic reduction – equivalent to closing 24 hospitals – amounts to a 10 per cent fall in NHS beds at a time when the health service is under unprecedented pressure  Health officials say patients recover more quickly if they are looked after in their own homes by GPs, district nurses and carers, but many surgeries and councils do not have the resources to care for people who would previously have stayed longer in hospital.  At the same time, demand for beds is soaring due to the pressures of a social care crisis, immigration and an ageing population, with many more patients succumbing to long-term illnesses and frailty.  New figures today will suggest the problem is likely to get worse. Regulator NHS Improvement will warn that despite being given a £1.8 billion cash injection from the Government last year, hospitals are on course for a £1 billion deficit by the end of this year.  The figures will spark a fresh debate about whether the NHS is contributing to its problems by squandering precious resources.  One report yesterday said hospitals had blown £2 billion by overpaying for items such as toilet roll, blinds and wet wipes, with items that could have been sent in one hospital’s internal mail being sent by Royal Mail instead.  The British Medical Association BMA warned that the loss of 15,000 beds ‘risked patient safety’ because nothing had been done to improve the level of care at home.  The lack of beds means hospitals are having to cancel operations at the last minute – including cancer and heart surgery – or send patients home before they have properly recovered.  Hospitals have axed 15,000 beds in just six years, leaving wards at ‘breaking point’, a shock report reveals today  The BMA report also highlights how the NHS has fewer beds per head than nearly every country in Europe  The BMA report also highlights how the NHS has fewer beds per head than nearly every country in Europe. The UK has an average of 2.4 beds per 1,000 population, compared to Germany 8, Austria 7.5 and France 6.  And it raises concerns over occupancy rates on wards. Hospitals are not meant to be more than 85 per cent occupied, but the report highlights figures showing that nine out of ten exceeded this over the winter. Several hospitals are 99 or even 100 per cent occupied with patients at much higher risk of infections and neglect.  Last week an inquest heard that grandmother Mary Muldowney, 57, from Crawley, West Sussex, died from a brain haemorrhage after three hospitals refused to admit her because they had no beds.  Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA’s council, said: ‘These figures paint an even bleaker picture of an NHS that is at breaking point.  Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA’s council, said: ‘These figures paint an even bleaker picture of an NHS that is at breaking point'  ‘High bed occupancy is a symptom of wider pressure and demand on an overstretched and underfunded system. It causes delays in admissions, operations being cancelled and patients being unfairly and sometimes repeatedly let down.  'The delays that vulnerable patients are facing, particularly those with mental health issues, have almost become the norm and this is unacceptable.’  The bed shortage is being exacerbated by the bed-blocking crisis, caused by the problems in the social care sector. With a shortage of home help and places at residential care homes, elderly and vulnerable patients are staying in hospital longer than they should.  Former health minister, Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb, said: ‘The situation is getting intolerable, with more cancelled operations, longer delays and those with mental health issues being systematically let down. The Government is failing to properly fund the NHS and patients are paying the price.’  Today’s figures cover all hospital beds, including those on general and maternity wards, as well as in mental health and learning disability centres. An average hospital has 634 beds, so a loss of 15,000 beds is equivalent to almost 24 hospitals.  Fiona Johnson, of the Nuffield Trust think-tank, said: ‘The extremely high level of bed occupancy in England’s hospitals creates pressure-cooker conditions for the NHS.  ‘The drive to achieve efficiencies by reducing bed numbers has become counterproductive, as there is no slack in the system to accommodate surges in demand and as a result procedures and operations get delayed.’  Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘The shameful reality is this overcrowding puts patients at risk and blows apart ministers’ claims to be prioritising safety.’  FAMILY DOCTORS ARE OFFERING FIVE-MINUTE APPOINTMENTS Family doctors are offering patients urgent appointments lasting only five minutes in a bid to meet soaring demand. A snapshot survey found several surgeries offering the same-day slots for anyone who thinks they need to be seen immediately. This includes parents worried about sick children or patients with chest pain or breathing difficulties. GP appointments in England usually last ten minutes and are already among the shortest in Europe. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, of the British Medical Association, said: ‘Five minutes is woefully too short. 'Nine out of ten GPs say they cannot manage in ten-minute appointments.’ Advertisement  An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Modern treatment advances such as minimally invasive surgery, fast-acting anaesthetics and medicines taken at home mean that the length of time patients spend in hospital has been falling in all Western countries.  ‘The NHS is highly efficient overall, but there are still meaningful differences in discharge practices and community support across England.’  The Department of Health said: Our hospitals are busier than ever but thanks to the hard work of staff, our performances are still among the best in the world. We have backed the NHS’s own plan for the future with an extra £10 billion by 2020.’",other

The Prime Minister has come under fire in recent days, with calls for Britain to accept a greater number of Syrian refugees in the wake of the unprecedented amount of migrant tragedies in the Mediterranean. His decision to take in more refugees from camps on the borders of war-torn Syria came shortly after heartbreaking photos of two dead Syrian boys washed up on a Turkish beach began circulating online. Mr Cameron said he was “deeply moved” by the pictures and blamed their deaths on the Islamic State ISIS, criminal gangs and Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad.  Speaking today, he said: As a father and as a human being you cannot help but be moved by these terrible pictures, seeing the picture of that poor child on the beach in Turkey. Those images will remain with all of us for a very very long time. But the question you have to ask not just as a father but as a Prime Minister is what are the actions we can take that will really make a difference? That is why, in taking additional refugees, because of course every one we take we can offer a new chance and a new life to, I think it is important we take them from Syrian refugee camps. I want to send the message out that the best way to get a new life is not to make this perilous journey.  AP Tima Kurdi, touches a photo of her nephews Aylan and Galib Kurdi  Downing Street declined to put a precise figure on the number of Syrians who will be admitted to the country, saying that details of the scheme were being finalised and will be announced next week. The additional £100million funding pledge for refugee camps on Syria's borders brings the total contribution from the UK to more than £1billion, making it Britain's largest ever response to a humanitarian crisis, said Mr Cameron. As Europe struggles to deal with what is the greatest migrant crisis in its history, a dramatic East-West split has formed as the EU. Brussels, Germany and France want to force all EU nations - including Britain - to take their share of up to 160,000 refugees. But Hungary, which has borne the brunt of a recent influx of migrants, and Poland are steadfastly refusing to accept any more, insisting it is not their problem. The remarks from Mr Cameron came as French President Francois Hollande delivered a thinly-veiled swipe at the UK by complaining that some countries were not “shouldering their moral obligations”. France and Germany had earlier agreed to propose a permanent and mandatory system to take in refugees and asylum seekers, especially Syrians, in the European Union EU. “I believe that today what we have done is not enough,” Mr Hollande said in Paris. “There are countries - I am not going to name them here because we are here to work with everybody - and these countries are not shouldering their moral obligations.”  REUTERS Desperate migrant family on the tracks at Bicske, in Hungary, yesterday  Announcing the migrant agreement German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: “The French-German position, which we will transmit to the European institutions, is that we agree that we need binding quotas within the European Union to share the burden. That is the principle of solidarity.” She said the “economic power and size of countries should play a role” in the number of migrants they are asked to take in, but stressed that without quotas, “we cannot solve this problem.” It also emerged that EU leaders have drawn up a plan to relocate 160,000 refugees around the Continent.    Under the new scheme, masterminded by European Commission EC President Jean-Claude Juncker, migrants stranded in Italy, Greece and Hungary will be transferred to countries across the EU based on their population and economic wealth. It will see Germany granting asylum to 35,000 refugees, France accepting 26,000 and Spain 16,000. Bulgaria and Romania will be expected to take thousands of families. Britain refused to join up to scheme earlier this year. However, splits were already emerging over the plan. EC President Donald Tusk admitted there was a “divide between the east and the west of the EU” over the plan to force all countries to accept a share of the refugees.  EXPRESS  REUTERS Migrants storm a train in Budapest yesterday as the station re-opens after two days  REUTERS A boy is lifted through a window as hundreds crowd on to a packed train  We have a moral duty to act to take in more of these people and help them to rebuild their lives Acting Labour leader Harriet Harman  Mr Tusk also warned that Europe would descend into “political blackmail, divisions and a new blame game” unless all countries pull their weight. But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who was holding talks with Mr Tusk, said that the flow of migrants was a “German problem”. “The problem is not a European problem, the problem is a German problem. Nobody would like to stay in Hungary, neither in Slovakia nor Poland nor Estonia. All of them would like to go to Germany,” he said. He told critics to stop blaming Hungary for the crisis and said that his country’s decision to force refugees to register meant it was just obeying EU rules before adding that Europeans were “full of fear because they see that the European leaders ... are not able to control the situation.” “Hungary did everything to fulfil regulations,” Mr Orban said. “Don’t criticise Hungary for doing what is compulsory.” The pugnacious Right-wing politician also argued that Europe’s open-door policy was fuelling the crisis. “If we would create ... an impression that ‘just come because we are ready to accept everybody’, that would be a moral failure. The moral, human thing is to make clear: Please don’t come,” he said. “Turkey is a safe country. Stay there. It’s risky to come.

59a9ea73,"Harry and Meghan's home renovations cost £2.4m in taxpayer funds he Duke and Duchess of Sussex's home was renovated with £2.4m of taxpayer-funded costs, royal accounts show.  Frogmore Cottage in Windsor was turned into a single property for Prince Harry and Meghan, from five separate homes.  The couple, who moved from Kensington Palace in April before the birth of their son Archie, paid for fittings.  The Queen's Sovereign Grant from the Treasury was £82m in 2018-19, with £33m set aside for maintenance, including major work on Buckingham Palace.  The Sovereign Grant is funded by profits from the Crown Estate.  The estate is the Royal Family's commercial property arm and owns land and buildings in prime central London locations and across the UK. It is managed by an independent organisation, with any profit paid to the Treasury for the benefit of all UK taxpayers.  Separate accounts show the Crown Estate provided a record £343.5m to the Treasury in 2018-19, up 4.3% on last year. 'Our responsibility'  The royal accounts said the renovation of Frogmore Cottage was paid out of the Sovereign Grant and involved the reconfiguration and full refurbishment of five residential units in poor condition to create the official residence for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.  The 19th Century, Grade II-listed, property was given to them by the Queen.  It sits in the grounds of royal residence Frogmore House, where Prince Harry and Meghan held their wedding reception in May 2018.      Who lived in Harry and Meghan's house?     Harry and Meghan split from royal charity     Harry and Meghan move to Windsor     MPs back £369m Buckingham Palace revamp  Defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced and inefficient heating systems updated. The house also required extensive rewiring - including an electrical sub-station - and the installation of gas and water mains.  The refurbishment took about six months although some areas are yet to be completed, such as repainting the exterior.  Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, said: The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation in line with our responsibility to maintain the condition of the occupied royal palaces estate.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also carried out renovations before moving into their Kensington Palace home in 2013, spending more than £4m on converting offices into an apartment. Taxpayer-funded spending on the royals has been a sensitive topic for decades.  That's why Palace officials went out of their way to explain how much had to be done to Frogmore Cottage, and how anything over basic fixtures and fittings would be paid for by the couple themselves.  The Sovereign Grant is to cover the cost of official duties and for the upkeep of royal palaces.  However, some will ask, why did the couple have to move out of Kensington Palace?  And why, if they felt that strongly about it, didn't they pay for the refurbishment of the house in Windsor themselves? Presentational grey line  The Royal Family's core sovereign grant is based on 15% of the net surplus of the Crown Estate, and allocated two years in arrears.  From 2017-18, the total grant was increased to 25% of the surplus for a 10-year period - with the extra funding intended to meet the £369m costs of refurbishing Buckingham Palace.  Excluding money transferred to reserves for future building work at the palace, the Queen's official expenses last year were £67m, a 41% year-on-year increase, the figures show.  A large amount of the rise was due to the ongoing renovation at Buckingham Palace, and work on the other occupied royal residences.  The campaign group Republic questioned why money had been spent on Frogmore Cottage at a time while public services were under financial pressure.  Graham Smith, from Republic, called for a parliamentary inquiry into royal spending, adding: The general funds of the Treasury should not be spent on individual members of the royal family at all - even if we had all the money to spend on public services it should not be happening. Presentational grey line What is the Crown Estate?      An independent commercial property business and one of the largest property portfolios in the UK     The majority of assets are in London, but the estate also owns property in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland     Holdings include Windsor Great Park and Ascot racecourse, but most of the portfolio is made up of residential property, commercial offices, shops, businesses and retail parks     Managed by an independent organisation, with any profit paid to the Treasury for the benefit of all UK taxpayers     Dates back from the time of the Norman Conquest     Has been managed on behalf of the government since 1760 when George III handed over its running in return for an annual payment     Funds the Sovereign Grant which supports the official duties of the Queen and maintains the occupied royal palaces  Presentational grey line  The royal accounts show the cost of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall's official travel by air and rail funded by the Sovereign Grant rose by almost a third last year to £1.3m, as the couple took on more royal duties from the Queen.  The report said there was a 98% increase in carbon emissions from flights used on official royal visits overseas in 2018-19 - going up to 3,344 tonnes of CO2 from 1,687.  Buckingham Palace said the rise was due to higher usage of chartered large fixed wing aircraft for foreign business travel, adding there was five such overseas visits in 2018-19 compared to one the previous year.  The trips are decided by the Foreign Office.  The accounts also reveal the Duke of Edinburgh maintains an office with a private secretary and receives £359,000 annuity from the Treasury. Despite retiring from public duties in 2017, Prince Philip has an official relationship with hundreds of organisations and charities,  Separately, the Prince of Wales pays for the public duties of Prince Harry and Meghan and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and some of their private costs, out of his Duchy of Cornwall income, which was £21.6m last year.  Accounts from Clarence House show this funding - in the year Meghan officially joined the Royal Family - stood at just over £5m, up 1.8% on 2017-18.

1c068671,"UK faces return to inequality of Thatcher years, says report Pressure on the government to help struggling Britons has intensified after a leading thinktank warned that falling living standards for the poor threatened the biggest rise in inequality since Margaret Thatcher was prime minister.  The Resolution Foundation said Theresa May would need to make good on her pledge to support “just about managing” households as it released a report showing that rising inflation and an end to recent strong jobs growth would hit the least well-off hardest.  Its warnings chime with other forecasts for a squeeze on family budgets on the back of sluggish wage growth, welfare cuts, rising global oil prices and the pound’s sharp fall since the Brexit vote. The drop in sterling has made imports more expensive and there are already signs that is being passed on to consumers, with inflation hitting its highest level for more than two years in December.  The Resolution Foundation’s study found that the current parliament would be the worst for living standards for the poorest half of households since comparable records began in the mid-1960s and the worst since the early years of Thatcher’s 1979-90 premiership for inequality.  Since its sharp increase in the early 1980s – a period of high unemployment, factory closures and a cut in the top rate of tax from 83% to 60% – inequality has broadly remained flat.  But the Resolution Foundation forecast that between 2015 and the next general election in 2020 incomes for the poorest half of households will fall by 2%.  That compares with a rise of 4% during the last parliament and 1% between 2005 and 2010 – the five-year period that included the deepest recession since the 1930s.    Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: “Britain has enjoyed a welcome mini-boom in living standards in recent years. But that boom is slowing rapidly as inflation rises, productivity flatlines and employment growth slows.  “The squeeze in the wake of the financial crisis tended to hit richer households the most. But this time around it’s low- and middle-income families with kids who are set to be worst affected.  “This could leave Britain with the worst of both worlds on living standards – the weak income growth of the last parliament and rising inequality from the time Margaret Thatcher was in Downing Street.  “The prime minister’s focus on supporting just managing families is absolutely right if we are to avoid the next few years being like the 1980s without the feelgood factor.”  The prediction that inequality is set to start rising again is based on the thinktank’s forecast that while incomes will fall for the poorer half of households they will rise by about 5% for the richest fifth over the next four years.  The foundation blames the upcoming living standards squeeze on a combination of stagnating pay, rising inflation and the rollout of more than £12bn of welfare cuts. It emphasised that the pound’s weakness since the Brexit vote and other economic factors such as flat productivity growth were only part of the picture. The unequal nature of the squeeze would be the result of government policy on tax and benefits.    “The vote to leave the European Union does not, thus far, appear to have impacted on the macroeconomy or employment, but it has hastened the end of ultra-low inflation and increased how far it is likely to rise in the next few years,” the report said.  “But, in some ways regardless of the average level of household income growth, Britain is also actively choosing to increase inequality. Despite welcome policies such as the national living wage, the plans the new prime minister has inherited are likely to ensure that the proceeds of growth are shared unequally and many families made worse off.”    The thinktank sees inequality rising to record highs by 2020 on three different measures: the 90:10 income ratio, which is the income of a household 90% up the income distribution scale, divided by that of a household only 10% of the way up; on the 80:20 ratio, calculated in a similar way from those 80% up the distribution and those 20% up; and on the Palma ratio, the income share of the top 10% divided by the income share of the bottom 40%.  “All forecast measures show large increases in inequality over the next four years, with all reaching record highs by 2020-21. This is a starkly different pattern from the trend of the past 20 years, over which time inequality has been broadly flat or even declining,” the report said.    Underscoring the challenge for May’s government as it seeks to redress deep regional imbalances in the UK, the Resolution Foundation also highlighted persistent inequalities between south-east England and the rest of the country.  Incomes in the vast majority of the country were more than 10% lower than in most wealthy region, south-east England, its analysis found. North-east England and the West Midlands had the lowest levels of income, both 20% lower than in the south-east.  On the capital, the report added: “Contrary perhaps to received wisdom London is not the region with the highest income, and once housing costs are taken into account, incomes in the region are roughly 10% lower than in the south-east.”  A spokesperson for the Treasury said: “Living standards reached their highest ever level in 2015, and are forecast to be higher still by the end of the parliament.    “Millions of people are taking home more of what they earn thanks to the government’s actions to reduce income tax bills and introduce the national living wage. We are helping households with the cost of living by increasing the supply of affordable housing, banning letting agents’ fees, and freezing fuel duty, and our investment to boost productivity will raise living standards in the long run.”  John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the Resolution Foundation was damning: “Labour called on the government at the autumn statement to end the unfair cuts to in work benefits, while they were going ahead with tax giveaways to a wealthy minority, but Philip Hammond chose to carry on with the work of his predecessor.  “It is becoming clearer by the day that working families will be forced to pay for a Tory Brexit that favours the rich and not the rest of us, as our country faces its biggest rise in inequality since Margaret Thatcher.”",other
"2,57400000000000E+20","Strike by doctors will put 200 lives at risk, says fellow NHS medic   Doc calls for a return to negotiations By DR JONATHAN STANLEY 12th January 2016, 12:01 am Updated: 6th April 2016, 9:54 am  TODAY my colleagues are going out on strike.  It is unprecedented, threatens patients’ dignity and safety — and it is unnecessary.  For me, it’s also illegal. That’s why today, I’m calling — along with think tank the Bow Group — for the British Medical Association BMA to call off its strikes and return to negotiations to bag the settlement we all need.  Savvy tactics from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt led to the Government going in too hard in talks none of us can walk away from.  That’s why a ballot was held.  But even back in November there was no reason why the BMA couldn’t have gone to mediators Acas first before upping the ante.  No one can honestly say that doctors, or the conditions on offer, are the same as what they were when the ballot was called. For me, the strike mandate ended when Acas talks started.  READ MORE:  Corbyn’s mob in doc strike as Momentum sends lefties to join picket line  Strike by junior doctors could drag on ‘for months’, says union boss  Moet medics: High life of docs’ leaders who are heading up NHS strike  Just days before the current talks broke down we all saw BMA reps briefing the media about how badly the whole thing was going.  Union bigwigs close to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn turned up the heat and the talks, naturally, collapsed.  With little chance of Labour returning to power any time soon we are now seeing Corbyn’s “new kind of politics” — a return to direct action to undermine the Government come what may.  His friends inside my union are leveraging the trust and goodwill we’ve spent years building and are weaponising my colleagues and our patients.  There has been no attention given to the victims of recent floods, who have lost so much and had operations cancelled.  With these strikes going ahead it is nonsense to say we can diagnose and treat cancers on time or that we can continue to see those suffering with mental health problems.  And it is nonsense to say the whole profession is behind the strikes — so many grades weren’t even balloted.  There are many different voices saying how many patients may die from understaffing over weekends and over these strikes.  The research I’ve worked on with the Bow Group suggests that more than two hundred lives could be lost just over the three days of industrial action this month.  There is our human side to this debate too. Thousands of us have worked hard to get into medicine.  We see so many patients suffer from their illnesses and are privileged to be there to help them as best we can.  I’ve worked as a doctor since 2005. I see the devastation when an operation is delayed, the anguish when a cancer is picked up late.  Paying me any more or working me any less will never blunt what I see.  Fair wages are fair, and I support the BMA in arguing for them.  Talks collapse ... Dr Stanley blames Corbyn's 'new type of politics' for breakdown  Reuters 1  We all want fair pay through negotiation. But there are many aspects of safety the current talks haven’t even touched upon.  For example, changing our rotas so senior doctors can stay on two weeks more in August — when newly qualified doctors start — would help the new doctors begin their careers in a safer and more supportive environment.  I’m sick of hearing how my colleagues will leave the country if they don’t get all that they want, that they’ll somehow be forced on to a plane to the Great Barrier Reef.  No one is forcing anyone to do anything and we have a debt to repay.  Doctors are one in eight of all NHS staff but we get three-fifths of the training budget.  That’s great, of course, because we really do need the best training to treat you. But why can’t clawbacks be written into our contracts so that if we leave as consultants for warmer climes we must pay back our training?  It takes £400,000 to train a GP — and for surgeons and cardiologists it’s even more.  Two thousand senior doctors leaving the UK would cost us a billion. More than twice that number applied to work abroad just last year.  But with competition for training and for medical school so high, I have to admit we’ve been too easy on those wishing to walk off with the loot.  In fact, if we did close this loophole maybe Jeremy Hunt would have more money to spend on nurses, medicines and, yes, on increasing our pay too.  I have seen emails and briefings from BMA negotiators attacking the Government, calling Hunt a liar, calling for other unions and left-wing groups to join pickets.  I won’t breach confidentiality by publishing these documents, you’ll have to take my word for it.  These briefings are not in my name, and they don’t represent the views of most junior doctors I know.  They make it clear to me there are elements of the BMA that wanted a strike from the moment they got their ballot and have no intention of returning to talks.  Where does that leave the public?  Strikes, I fear, will increase in number and severity.  Maybe, in time for May’s local elections, Corbyn will ride to the rescue and save the day from the strikes he prompted. He may even reward some of his Labour friends inside the profession, but the end result will be a conspiracy against the public and the patients.  I support the BMA, I have been a member for ten years. It does vital work for doctors and, ultimately, serves all of our interests.  But it has allowed a few members with a radical left-wing agenda very different to the union’s own to hijack it.  I will lose friends in calling out this failure to avoid strikes where possible.  I remember my early days of training at Sheffield Medical School and its motto shines through: “The art is long and life is short.”  The standing, trust and legacy of the medical profession is bigger than this showdown — and it has to be. There is a difference between being a professional and an employee. This is an employee dispute, but we are professionals crucial to the life of the nation.  We need to start acting like it.  — Dr Jonathan Stanley is a junior doctor and a member of the Royal College of Surgeons.

9b14da53,"Junior doctors row: 98% vote in favour of strikes Junior doctors in England have overwhelmingly voted in favour of going on strike in their dispute with ministers over a new contract.  Some 98% voted in favour of a full strike and 99% in favour of action just short of a full strike.  The first walk-out will start on 1 December with another two dates earmarked for later in the month.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the doctors' decision was very, very disappointing news.  And he rejected calls for talks to be held at conciliation service Acas, although he would not rule it out completely.

The action is likely to lead to the cancelling and rescheduling of thousands of routine appointments, tests and operations with the NHS forced to prioritise emergency cases.  The union has asked the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service Acas to get involved to offer independent arbitration - something the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which normally stays out of politics, has said it supports.  The dates for industrial action are:      08:00 GMT 1 December to 08:00 GMT 2 December junior doctors to staff emergency care     08:00 GMT to 17:00 8 December full strike     08:00 GMT to 17:00 16 December full strike  The BMA balloted just over 37,700 members - over two-thirds of the workforce - and 76% took part in the ballot.  Paris attacks: The young doctor who treated first casualties line What will happen in a strike? Doctorimage copyrightPA  Services will be disrupted, make no mistake about that. But the British Medical Association argues the aim of doctors taking part will not be to maximise that - as is the goal in many other industrial disputes.  On the first day of action that has been earmarked, junior doctors will still staff emergency care. On the other two dates, they will walk out in the knowledge there will be other medics - consultants, staff doctors and locums - that can plug the gaps.  Whether that will be enough for hard-pressed emergency services will be argued over ahead, during and after any walkout.  What is certain, though, is routine services will suffer. Hip operations, knee replacement and routine clinics will have to be cancelled.  In fact, as happened the last time doctors took action in 2012, over pensions, expect hospitals to start rearranging services in advance. Want to know more about the dispute?      The junior doctors row explained     What exactly do junior doctors do?     A nightmare for the NHS and patients     How does your job compare?     NHS v ministers: A case of deja vu?  line  The vote comes after thousands of doctors have taken part in a series of protests in recent months in the contract dispute.  Talks broke down last year, and ministers have since said they will impose the new contract from next year.  As the ballot papers went out a fortnight ago, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt made a last ditch attempt to persuade doctors to accept the offer.  He wrote to all the doctors in the country with a fresh offer.  It included a promise of an 11% rise in basic pay, but the BMA said this was misleading as it was offset by curbs to other elements of the pay package, including unsociable hours payments.  Ministers have promised to protect pay for the first three years of the deal.  But the BMA has said there are insufficient safeguards to stop hospitals overworking doctors and they could lose out financially in the long term. Junior doctors row  55,000  junior doctors in England  37,700  balloted over industrial action      £3.1bn spent on junior doctor pay currently      11% rise in basic pay offered      25% cut in weekly hours that attract a premium unsociable hours payment  Source: Department of Health and BMA Science Photo Library  After the result of the ballot was announced, BMA leader Dr Mark Porter said: We regret the inevitable disruption that this will cause but it is the government's adamant insistence on imposing a contract that is unsafe for patients in the future, and unfair for doctors now and in the future, that has brought us to this point.  Our message to him is that junior doctors have today made their views perfectly clear but that it is still possible to get back around the negotiating table to deliver a contract that is safe for patients, contains the necessary contractual safeguards to prevent junior doctors being overworked and properly recognises evening and weekend work.  Meanwhile, Labour shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander has written to the prime minister to ask him to intervene, saying the profession had lost confidence in Mr Hunt. She also wants to see independent arbitration.  The letter - seen by the BBC - says: With the NHS facing its most difficult winter in recent memory, and the prospect of industrial action now looming, it is imperative that urgent steps are taken to resolve this dispute. Graphic  Roger Goss, of the campaign group Patient Concern, criticised the way both sides had handled the dispute but said doctors should not go on strike.  This is the worst news for patients in the history of the NHS. What happened to the promise that the interests of patients are paramount and we put patients first?  Any honourable doctor with a genuine vocation who wants to preserve the high esteem which the medical profession currently enjoys will refuse to cause suffering inherent in a full-scale walk-out.  Scotland and Wales have said they do not want to introduce the contract changes, while Northern Ireland has yet to make a decision.  ",partial
9289000c,"Record number of Britons are now in work since Brexit referendum More Britons are in work than ever despite predictions of huge job losses in the event of a vote for Brexit.  Official figures released yesterday showed that employment is at a record high, with more than 2,000 people finding work every day.  The workforce has grown to 32.34million – the highest level since records began in 1971, according to the Office for National Statistics. The total has risen by 609,000 since the referendum of June 2016.  Official figures released yesterday showed that employment is at a record high, with more than 2,000 people finding work every day. Before the vote George Osborne claimed up to 820,000 jobs could be lost within two years if Britain chose to leave  Before the vote George Osborne claimed up to 820,000 jobs could be lost within two years if Britain chose to leave.  ‘These figures just show how ridiculous and discredited Project Fear is,’ said pro-Brexit Tory MP Andrew Bridgen. ‘Britain has nothing to fear from taking back control of its money, its borders and its laws.’  Sir Bill Cash, a fellow Conservative MP, said the figures showed Brexit was ‘a great opportunity’ that was being put at risk by diehard Remainers.  The ONS also said the number of European Union citizens working in Britain had gone up since the referendum.  Almost 2.37million had jobs in March – 155,000 more than in early 2016. And workers from outside the EU have risen by 235,000 over the past two years.  Yesterday’s report from the ONS raised hopes that the economic slowdown at the start of this year would be temporary. The economy grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first quarter while output per hour – a key measure of productivity – dropped by 0.5 per cent.  Almost 2.37million had jobs in March – 155,000 more than in early 2016. And workers from outside the EU have risen by 235,000 over the past two years  But Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ‘We can be proud of our record on jobs. The unemployment rate is at its lowest in over 40 years.’  John Longworth, the former head of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘Once again Project Fear has been trounced by the outstanding jobs figures.  ‘At the same time, we see that the German economy has slowed and unemployment remains unacceptably high in many EU countries.’  An extra 3.2million people have joined the workforce since the Tories came to power in coalition in 2010. Four in five men aged between 16 and 64 are now in work, the highest proportion since 1991. Unemployment has dropped to a 43-year low of 4.2 per cent – compared with 8.5 per cent in the eurozone.  Unemployment has dropped to a 43-year low of 4.2 per cent – compared with 8.5 per cent in the eurozone  The total fell by 46,000 over the first three months of the year to 1.42million – 116,000 lower than a year earlier.  An average of 2,189 jobseekers found work every day in the first three months of the year.  John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: ‘The great British job-creating machine kicked back into life in the first quarter of 2018.  ‘All of this good news stands in marked contrast to the subdued GDP growth of just 0.1 per cent. This estimate could be revised up later. But productivity growth turned negative again after a couple of quarters when it seemed to be perking up. This may reflect the fact that the downturn in output due to the cold weather in the first quarter did not lead to job losses given that it was seen as a purely temporary setback.’  Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said the post-crisis jobs boom in the UK was a big achievement given persistent fears over the threat to jobs from technology and machines.  German growth falls The eurozone economy slowed sharply at the start of the year as Germany and France stumbled, official figures showed yesterday. Output in the single currency bloc rose by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter of the year following a 0.7 per cent increase in the previous three months. The region was held back by Germany and France – the engine rooms of the eurozone. Growth in Germany slowed from 0.6 per cent to 0.3 per cent in the first quarter. At the same time, the pace of expansion in France dropped from 0.7 per cent to 0.3 per cent. The figures, from official statistics agency Eurostat, fuelled fears that the recovery in the eurozone is running out of steam after a solid performance in 2017. And while unemployment in the UK has fallen to a 43-year low of 4.2 per cent, it remains stubbornly high at 8.5 per cent in the eurozone. Peter Vanden Houte, chief economist at banking group ING, said: ‘The weaker first quarter might be the new normal.’ The unemployment rate in France is 8.8 per cent, 11 per cent in Italy and 16.1 per cent in Spain. The average across the advanced world is 5.4 per cent. Advertisement  Esther McVey, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said: ‘Since 2010 we have seen 3.2million more people move into work right across the UK.  ‘Youth unemployment has fallen by over 40 per cent and the unemployment rate at its joint lowest since 1975. Today’s figures once again cement that turnaround, with a new employment rate record of 75.6 per cent, and on average over 1,000 people each and every day, since 2010, getting a job.  ‘With wages growing faster than inflation and increases in the personal tax allowance, not only are more people bringing home a pay packet but they are keeping more of their hard earned money for themselves and their families.’  The Bank of England believes the official growth figure of just 0.1 per cent in the first quarter will be revised up to 0.3 per cent over time.  Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the Ernst & Young Item Club, said: ‘The labour market figures suggests that the economy may not be as weak as some of the recent data suggest. It may fuel hopes that the economy can bounce back after GDP growth slowed in the first quarter.’  The ONS also said wages were rising at the fastest pace for nearly three years as businesses took on more staff.  Average pay rose 3 per cent to a record £484 a week in the year to March. It was the biggest rise since 2015 and ahead of inflation at 2.5 per cent.",truth
87ad7cb5,"Boris Johnson warns of EU migration 'risks' Staying in the EU is the riskier option for the UK because it will be unable to control rising migration, Boris Johnson has warned.  The ex-London mayor said population growth was the biggest economic change in the UK for a century.  His fellow Leave campaigner Michael Gove said the EU was undermining our population's security.  David Cameron accused the Leave campaign of trying to peddle fantasy politics.  Remain campaigners also dismissed Mr Johnson's claim the UK would be unable to resist extra payment demands from Brussels as nonsense because EU leaders had already agreed the UK would not pay towards future bailouts.  The UK also had a veto over future budget increases, they added.      Follow the latest updates with BBC EU Referendum Live     Reality Check: Will the UK pay for future euro bailouts     David Cameron likens Brexit 'bomb under economy'     Pro-EU MPs 'consider single market move'  Vote Leave attempted to counter repeated warnings by the government about the consequences of leaving the EU at an event in Stratford-upon-Avon featuring Mr Johnson, Mr Gove and Labour MP Gisela Stuart where they set out what they said were risks of remaining.  Mr Johnson said the population growth was partly down to migration driven by the crisis in the eurozone and challenged the Remain side to spell out a plan for the pressure it was causing on housing and the NHS.  Labour MP and Remain campaigner Harriet Harman said these were the responsibility of the government, not the EU.  Mr Johnson also said his side was winning all the democratic points and that the Remain arguments were morally and practically and completely wrong. line EU Referendum Reality Check      Will the UK pay for future euro bailouts?     Are we giving £350m a week to Brussels?     How much does the EU Budget cost the UK?     Read more from Reality Check  line  The benefits of the single market were wildly overstated, Mr Johnson claimed, saying the UK could not be insulated from the cost of bailing out the failings of the eurozone and other hikes in costs.  Taking questions afterwards, he rejected the idea that David Cameron's renegotiation had secured protection for the UK from paying for future bailouts.  The deal has no legal basis at the moment and could be quite easily overridden, he said.  Mr Gove, the justice secretary, said the EU's borderless Schengen Zone - which the UK is not part of - actively abets terrorists.  He also said the policies of the single currency had led to the rise of extremist parties. line Analysis by Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor  For voters who are only just tuning into the EU referendum debate they might take one look and tune out again.  What they might see this morning - one side accusing the other of being a bunch of liars who you wouldn't trust to feed your cat, the other side claiming the others include bitter has-beens and a load of sneering patricians telling you they know best.  Political debate that, in some moments, isn't much more sophisticated than a bunch of school kids shouting pants on fire at each other in the playground.  Given this is one of the biggest choices we have made as a country for generations - I know that sounds trite but it is true - it's not exactly edifying to watch, and as happened during the wilder days of the Scottish referendum, this campaign is dabbling in a world where the truth is not a safe anchor.  Read more from Laura line  Vote Leave says new figures suggest the UK could face a £2.4bn extra bill soon after the referendum because of a backlog of unpaid bills and a delay in the review of the EU's budget.  But it faced a rebuke from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which responded after Mr Gove cited the think tank during a live Q&A on Sky News.  Speaking on Friday night, Mr Gove said: There are billions of pounds that we send to the European Union every year and the IFS has pointed out that if we took that money back, we could spend it on the NHS, we could use it to reduce VAT on fuel.  The IFS issued a statement saying the UK's net contribution to the EU would be eclipsed by even a small damage to the public finances caused by leaving.  It added: That is why we conclude that leaving the EU would not, as Michael Gove claims we said, leave more money to spend on the NHS. Rather it would leave us spending less on public services, or taxing more, or borrowing more.  At a separate event on Monday, which Britain Stronger in Europe called an unprecedented display of cross-party support, Mr Cameron, Ms Harman, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said refusing to set out an economic plan for Brexit was reckless and undemocratic.  They said: It's time for the Leave campaign to outline their economic plan for Britain outside Europe.  They are perpetuating an economic con-trick on the British people, and we're calling time on it. The British public deserve better than being asked to roll the dice.  They also unveiled a dossier on the often contradictory statements the Leave campaign has made on the economy, claiming it has had 23 positions on the alternative to the single market.  Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott described the claims as desperate stuff from an increasingly desperate campaign.  We have set out a series of pledges about how life will be better if we take back control. We want to invest more in the NHS, create 300,000 jobs through new trade deals, cut energy bills for families and introduce a new Australian style points-based immigration system, he said.  Meanwhile, in a letter to the Guardian, union leaders - including the general secretaries of Unite, Unison and the GMB - backed the campaign to remain in the EU.  They warned the Conservative government would negotiate away our rights if voters backed Brexit.  Workers' rights - including maternity and paternity rights, equal treatment for workers and the right to paid leave - had been negotiated with European partners, they said.  If Britain leaves the EU we are in no doubt these protections would be under great threat, the union added.  ",fake
f0737897,"Our NHS is safer in Europe: #NHSsaferIN Our NHS is safer in Europe: #NHSsaferIN  14 Jun 2016, by Frances O'Grady in Public services  Today I’m proud to be joining NHS staff and supporters at a rally at Congress House. We’re coming together to say don’t risk a leave vote – Don’t risk our NHS. And there’s a lot to concern us, whether we work in the NHS or rely on it for our families’ health care.  To start with, there’s the potential loss of so many talented NHS staff from the EU. That could unleash a staffing crisis in the NHS.  Where on earth would our NHS be without all the staff who are so dedicated to it: The doctors, nurses and support staff? The NHS staffing roster includes 50,000 staff from the European Economic Area – including 9,000 doctors, 18,000 nurses and midwives, and over 2,000 other health professionals.  These are people who fill crucial skills gaps, and use their incredible knowledge and expertise to help save British lives.  Of course the government should be investing more in training opportunities for locals. Our government’s NHS bursary cuts have been the worst thing possible in dealing with a growing training crisis.  But migrants don’t clog the NHS up – they prop it up.  Yes, our NHS is at breaking point. Staff are over-worked and services are stretched. But that’s not because of decent, hard-working migrants who pay their way. Migrants are often younger people, less likely to need health services than the average UK citizen but still paying UK taxes to support them.  The NHS is in a staffing crisis because the government has imposed another five-year spending freeze. The Tories’ pay cap has created recruitment and retention problems throughout the service, which means more and more taxpayers money is wasted on agencies and management consultants, increasing our deep reliance on EU healthcare staff.  Across the NHS, staff are demoralized – fed up with too little funding to help the patients they care so deeply about, too many top down reorganisations and not enough ministerial respect. And fed up that their dedication is being taken for granted.  The EU’s Working Time Directive means we have rules that protect staff wellbeing, and don’t needlessly risk patient safety. We already have dedicated health staff putting in long hours, but many Brexit leaders want to overturn their rights to refuse excessive working hours and push them to work even longer.  And of course funding for the NHS depends on Britain’s economy doing well. Pretty much everyone agrees leaving the EU will hit the economy even brexiteers admit it would hurt in the short term, and that will put our crisis hit NHS even deeper in trouble.  Based on IFS analysis, if we leave the EU, the public purse is likely to lose enough money each year to fund the whole of NHS England for 3 months.  Of course not all the public spending cuts would fall on the NHS. But it could still be as much as £10 billion a year by the end of the decade. Equivalent to every hospital trust in England cutting 1,000 nurses and 155 doctors.  But the thing that gets me about the discussion of the NHS in this referendum campaign is the hypocrisy. Because when did the leading lights of Brexit ever give a toss about the NHS?  Does anyone really believe that Boris Johnson cares about the NHS? That’s the same Boris Johnson who is on record saying he doesn’t believe in a free NHS; and that if people paid for services, they’d value them more.  Or Michael Gove who co-authored a book saying the NHS is “no longer relevant in the 21st century”? Or Iain Duncan Smith, who has said he’d prefer a social insurance system? Or even Nigel Farage, who believes that within the next ten years the NHS should be replaced by private health insurance?  I don’t believe they support the NHS as we know and love it, any more than I believe they oppose the EU/US TTIP trade deal. If we came out of the EU, these men would sign us up to their own secret trade deals like a shot. We wouldn’t even know about the deals; let alone have the chance to change them.  But perhaps the Leave campaign’s most shameful fib of all is the claim that leaving the EU would mean more money for the NHS. Frankly, I was gobsmacked when I first saw the Leave campaign’s battle bus slogan.  As the Tory MP and former GP Sarah Wollaston said last week, when she defected from leave to remain: “it simply isn’t true”. Even if we trusted them to do the right thing with the cash, the sums simply don’t add up. They’ve been repeatedly slammed for it by the UK’s statistics watchdog.  The leave campaign are fond of saying we remainers are negative. To be honest when faced with a change that could cause such damage it’s hard not to be. But there are also positive reasons to vote Remain for our NHS.  Being in the EU helps make our NHS better. It means a common set of professional standards across the EU. And when you’re away for work or on holiday, British citizens get the right to free healthcare in other member states.  It also means significant funding for research and development into health. Just last year, the UK received £232 million of EU money – incidentally the largest slice of funding received by any EU member state. That included vital money for research at Great Ormond Street children’s hospital, University Hospital Birmingham and NHS Blood and Transplant services. It keeps the NHS at the forefront of healthcare worldwide.  So we have a choice to make. To build our NHS – or risk it. To back our NHS – or privatise it. And to celebrate and cherish NHS staff – or demonise and divide them. A vote to Leave isn’t just a big gamble with jobs, wages and rights, it’s also a big gamble with our NHS.  The NHS was built by and for working people. It is about solidarity, collaboration and co-operation. And it is too special, too precious, to entrust to the privatising Tories and UKIP, who are pushing Brexit as a way towards a deregulated, low-tax and low-services UK.  The NHS needs to be safeguarded if it’s going to be able to care for our children and grandchildren. I’ll be voting remain to do that.",other
2cf85ad9,"PM 'will not hit' one million new homes target Theresa May put affordable housing at the heart of her offer to voters when she became prime minister.  The government's target is one million new homes by 2020; the argument being that more supply will bring down prices.  But the head of one of the UK's largest housebuilders, Berkeley Homes, says the target may be missed.  Radical change will be required to raise the current new-build rate above 170,000 per year, says Rob Perrins.  When I asked him if the target would be hit, his answer was emphatic.  The answer is no, and surprisingly the answer is not due to planning, he said.  There have been some very good reforms in planning over the past few years. [However] there are three reasons why they will not hit the target.  Firstly, there is not enough land ready for development.  Secondly, the UK has the highest property taxation in the world. And it acts as a disincentive to build and [for people to] move.  And thirdly, I don't believe it is a top three political issue. And there is nothing more important for those under 30 than resolving the housing crisis, Mr Perrins added.  He said the government should take the issue as seriously as funding the National Health Service.  I interviewed Mr Perrins on the Kidbrooke estate in south-east London, where Berkeley Homes is building 4,500 new homes - 1,500 of which will be cheaper affordable homes.  The Kidbrooke estate is Britain's housing crisis in microcosm.  In the 1960s, the area was called the Ferrier Estate, a depressing jungle of pre-cast concrete that had fallen into disrepair.  In the 1990s, the local council, Greenwich - which Mr Perrins describes as one of the best when it comes to backing housing development - starting planning to redevelop the site.  It took 10 years to achieve a development agreement for the area, signed in 2007. House buildingimage copyrightPA  There are 800 conditions attached to the planning permission, from the type of building materials used, to the type of energy supply needed, to the type of facilities - such as a new school and health centre - that will be provided.  All might be very necessary, but all slow down the system.  The final houses will not be completed until 2030 - more than 30 years after the council first earmarked the area for redevelopment. Slow progress  Building homes in the UK is a glacial business.  The real issue in my view is getting land ready for development, Mr Perrins said.  It is also about infrastructure. It's about electricity. It's about gas. It's about adjoining land permissions. It's about all the infrastructure issues around getting land ready, and there are an awful lot of those.  There are, of course, many other reasons put forward for the chronic shortage of new homes in the UK.  One is that housebuilders deliberately constrain supply to keep prices - and their profits - high.  The government is considering bringing in financial sanctions for housebuilders that do not develop land quickly enough.  That policy proposal could be fleshed out in a housing White Paper to be published before Christmas.  Mr Perrins dismissed this criticism of housebuilders, saying that companies like his were ready to build.  We take huge risks getting sites like this [Kidbrooke] ready for development, he said.  It's hugely complicated and we take those risks over a number of years.  It also requires an awful lot of capital. Sites like this require over £200m of capital to bring them forward, he pointed out. 'Raise our game'  Returns need to be good to keep shareholders - which include many people's pension funds - satisfied.  You mustn't bring in policies that are a disincentive to bringing house [building] forward, Mr Perrins said about any government action on fining companies that do not build new homes quickly enough.  The government owns 40% of the land in the UK; they have enough of their own land to solve the housing crisis, he added. Bricksimage copyrightPA  With Number 10 and the Treasury both saying that new housebuilding is a priority, the government department responsible for delivering on housing policy - communities and local government - is under scrutiny.  The housing minister, Gavin Barwell, told me he didn't agree the one million new homes target by 2020 would definitely be missed.  I certainly accept that at the current rate we are not going to hit it, so we need to raise our game, he said.  But I think if you look in both our own past and if you look to some of our near neighbours, it is possible to build the number of homes we need in this country and it is my job, working with my boss Sajid Javid [the Communities and Local Government Secretary] to make sure we do it, the minister added.  How? is the question governments have been asked for decades, ever since the 1960s and 1970s when house building was a public and private affair, with 100,000 council houses a year adding to the number built by private developers.  I think if there was a simple answer to that question, someone would have solved the problem already, Mr Barwell said.  I think there is a combination of things. In some parts of the country we are not releasing enough land into the system.  Then often people get planning permission, but it takes too long to turn that into a home - you can't live in a planning permission.  We're too slow to get spades in the ground when we've got planning permission.  I think we are too dependent on a small number of large housebuilders, so we need to broaden the range of the people who are doing the building.  And then we need to make sure we've got enough people in the country who have got the skills to work in the industry, he said.  Mrs May has been careful to avoid too many targets in her short time as prime minister.  But she knows the one million new homes by 2020 will be one for which voters can and will hold her accountable.  Expect a flurry of government activity - on simplifying planning rules and promoting local authority building - by the end of the year. ",fake
d56e6e70,"Number of NHS beds for mental health patients slumps by 30% The number of hospital beds for people with acute mental health conditions, where a consultant psychiatrist is on hand to oversee treatment, has fallen by almost 30% since 2009 despite repeated claims by ministers that improving care for the mentally ill is now a top priority.  New official figures show that the number of beds for those with some of the most serious conditions – including psychosis, serious depression leading to suicidal feelings and eating disorders – has fallen from 26,448 in 2009 to 18,082 in the first quarter of this year.  Over the same nine years, the data also show significant falls in the number of mental health nurses working in the NHS – from 46,155 to 39,358 – and in the number of doctors in specialist psychiatry training, from 3,187 in 2009 to 2,588 in the first quarter of this year.  Last night, the MP Dr Dan Poulter, a former Tory health minister who is now practising part-time as an NHS doctor in mental health services, said it was clear that government rhetoric about giving mental health “parity of esteem” with physical health was not matched by action.  Poulter, who obtained the new data through parliamentary answers, said that mental health was still a “Cinderella service”, with child and adolescent mental health lagging the furthest behind acceptable standards. The service in which he works is not just inadequate but also unsafe for patients, he claimed. “The reality on the ground is that there are ever fewer beds available for the patients who need them. This means that people who are very unwell, for example with psychosis or depression with suicidal ideation, are unable to access timely inpatient care. Eating disorders is another service where there is often a long wait for patients who need beds for urgent inpatient care. This is not safe for the patients.  “Mental health professionals work incredibly hard but we are under-resourced. Despite the need to expand services to meet the needs of patients, and to provide more support for people with mental illness in the community, there are simply not the resources available to do it.”  The shortage of beds leaves the most vulnerable shunted around the country or even in prison waiting for care they need. Janet Davies  Bed shortages are so severe in some parts of England that patients are sometimes sent hundreds of miles from home, and even to Scotland, to access inpatient care. Ministers have pledged to eradicate out-of-area care by 2020, but up to 700 people a month are still being cared for away from their home area.  Health organisations and charities said the data was further evidence that ministers were failing to respond adequately to a growing mental health crisis. Janet Davies, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said that the figures showed that politicians’ promises to improve NHS provision for those experiencing mental illness had not been honoured.  “Despite all the rhetoric on the importance of mental health, these figures show the painful reality. Thousands of experienced professionals have been lost and this shortage of inpatient beds leaves the most vulnerable shunted around the country or even in prison cells waiting for the care they desperately need,” Davies said.  Paul Farmer, chief executive of the mental health charity Mind and chairman of NHS England’s taskforce on mental health in 2015-16, said: “Mental health services have often been seen as a soft target for cuts, and these figures are a stark reminder of the longterm consequences of under-investing in the mental health workforce.”  The 2012 Health and Social Care Act established that there should be “parity of esteem” between physical and mental health. But despite promises of extra funding, many mental health trusts have been forced to cut acute mental health beds. Many NHS staff complain that services in the community are so inadequately funded that they fail to prevent patients with serious problems from ending up in hospital.  In October 2017, the prime minister Theresa May stressed that improving the treatment of mental health was one of her top priorities. “Tackling the injustice of mental illness is one of my absolute priorities as prime minister and I believe that by taking these steps together we as a society can transform how we think about mental illness, and improve the way we care for all those with mental health problems,” she said. But since then, the number of acute mental health beds has continued to fall and is now at its lowest for more than a decade. Last week, in the House of Commons, she admitted that more needed to be done, and that the service had been “overlooked for too long”.  NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens last week identified mental health as one of the five priorities that the service’s ten-year plan will need to tackle. Due in November, this will set out how the NHS will spend the extra £20bn it has been given. He warned, however, that improving mental health provision could take more than five years to achieve – because of understaffing.  However, in his first speech as the new health and social care secretary on Friday, Matt Hancock did not cite mental health as one of his three main priorities, despite Theresa May’s strong personal interest in the issue and description of it as one of British society’s “burning injustices”.  A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “Mental health is one of this government’s top priorities and we are committed to seeing services improve through record amounts of funding, an additional £1bn between 2017-18 and 2020-2021, and major increases to the workforce, with 21,000 new posts to be created by 2021.” Government sources said that there was a recognition that more nurses were needed, which was why ministers had announced an increase of more than 5,000 extra nurse-training places, which would be available from September, including mental health training places.",fake
24fd8f3f,"It's heartless to blame job losses on unemployed people – but it's how much of Britain thinks Howl, beat your head against the wall, tear your hair and despair of this country. How can it be that nearly half the population thinks the reason people lost their jobs in the pandemic was due to their own underperformance? Just 31% attribute it to bad luck. Look around every city and town to see the shuttered shops, closed offices, boarded-up pubs, bars and restaurants, the blindingly obvious signs of the mass loss of jobs. Yet again those on the left are forced to confront some dismal realities about British public attitudes.  King’s College London’s deep research into how people feel about inequality is enough to all but extinguish political hope. It’s nice to know that Labour supporters are kinder than their Tory counterparts, but even so, a shocking 39% of Labour voters think it’s people’s own fault they lost their jobs, as this week the unemployment rate hit 5%, with worse to come.  Why does it keep shocking us, since the British people have most commonly voted in Conservative governments, with Labour crushed again and again? The Brexit vote came as the heaviest hammer-blow in living memory, followed by Boris Johnson’s triumph. This research shows that enthusing the public with a strong enough will to significantly reduce inequality requires exceptionally clever efforts of persuasion.  “There is no widespread appetite for change,” concludes the final section of this devastating report. What a blow to all of us who hope this crisis can be a 1945 moment, that the state’s massive intervention for the survival of so many might have whetted the appetite for more. “We should not expect a widespread reappraisal of the case for greater government intervention in the economy, despite the economic hardship wrought by the pandemic,” is the sobering conclusion.  Its lead author, Professor Bobby Duffy, long-time Ipsos Mori researcher on social attitudes, reminded me that there has been historic change for the better in attitudes on race, gender and sexuality, and that younger people are considerably more progressive than those who are old. But when I talked to him, he warned that attitudes can change again: “It doesn’t mean there won’t be backsliding.”  He warned on race that a fixed 13% have toxic racist attitudes. A quarter of people think Covid causing a rise in ethnic inequality wouldn’t be problem, though 67% say it would. Gender inequality ranks low as a concern, possibly because an older generation remember how much that has already improved.  Here’s the great political gulf, which interestingly falls along Brexit-related lines: two-thirds of Labour remainers believe the crisis justifies more state intervention, compared to only one in five Conservative leavers. The pandemic has barely shifted views, despite all that clapping for carers and key workers. While 82% of Labour remainers believed Britain was unequal before the coronavirus outbreak, that view is shared by just 53% of Conservative leavers. What should be done about it now? That depends on how the question is phrased: use the word “redistribution” and support for action is just 48%, but phrase it as “government should take measures to reduce differences in income levels” and support rises to 62%. Tax those who are very rich and companies, but not themselves, is roughly how that translates, as in much other polling.  The one question of disadvantage on which most agree is inequality of place. Some 61% agree that inequalities between more and less deprived areas are the most serious kind. Paul Johnson, head of the IFS, for whom this research forms part of its Deaton Review of Inequalities, finds this startling. He puzzles over whether people mean north and south, say Burnley versus Twickenham, or do they, he hopes, mean the divide between poor and rich districts everywhere? London, for example, may have grotesque wealth among City bankers, but it has the most poverty too, and he says, is by far the hardest hit by unemployment caused by the pandemic. Averages deceive wickedly.  “Take the real divide between graduates and non-graduates,” Johnson says. “After counting housing costs, a graduate in Burnley has the same income as one in Twickenham, but lots more graduates living in Twickenham give it a high average.” Can that simple fact be explained, so people realise that levelling up is not just big projects in the north, but levelling up low incomes everywhere?  These findings will warm the cockles of Conservative hearts, but present painful dilemmas for Labour. Tackling inequality is Labour’s great cause, but that may be a rebarbative word with too many voters. Paul Johnson recalls, “Tony Blair never mentioned inequality, yet with tax credits, did more than any government to ease poverty.” Blair spoke instead of “social exclusion”. Those who criticise Keir Starmer for his caution should study this report in depth.  Most depressing is how many people attribute success and failure only to hard work and ambition: people believe this is a meritocracy, not a system governed by birth and luck. Prof Duffy talked of how since the 1970s individual blame has replaced systemic injustice as people’s explanation for inequality. Britain was at its most equal in 1975, but with the blast of Thatcherism that took the lid off top earnings and saw bottom earnings fall back, came a dose of Americanised individualism. More than half the workforce belonged to a union in the 1970s, and they were vectors not just of power, but political education. Now only 23% are members and unions’ political influence is weak in public discourse. The collective is replaced with a warped idea of merit, disseminated by the right, deliberately ignoring the social injustices that predestine futures from birth.  Because we have to live in hope, and yet also cleave to realism, this research suggests the best way to engage voters with inequality is through locality and place. But whisper the word.",partial
b88444d1,"Police force could lose 22,000 jobs under new spending cuts Planned government spending cuts will see at least 22,000 police jobs being lost, leaving the public protected by the lowest numbers of officers since the 1970s, according to a private estimate circulating among police chiefs.  The figure, obtained by the Guardian, is much higher than previously known, and means the number of police officers in England and Wales could fall to nearly 100,000.  The estimate being provided to chief constables is based on the lowest expected cut of 25% in the funding that government provides for policing between now and 2020. At present there are about 125,000 officers working in England and Wales.  After the budget in July from the newly elected Conservative government, the chancellor, George Osborne, told unprotected departments, such as the Home Office that funds the police, that their cuts would range from 25%-40%.  Senior Home Office officials and police have met in a “gold group” to formulate arguments to the Treasury ahead of its decision about how much more each department should save. The money each government department receives is announced in the comprehensive spending review which is due to be announced in November.  One senior officer told the Guardian: “This time a greater part of the reduction will be borne by police officers.” One police chief added that the cuts will mean fewer officers and a pruning back of neighbourhood policing and proactive prevention work which stops crime levels rising.  Privately, police chiefs believe the public do not appreciate the scale of cuts and what they will mean. They are resigned to further cuts given the wider cuts to public spending and are working on the basis that their funding will have been slashed by at least 40% or more from 2010 to 2020.  An estimated 17,000 officer posts were eliminated in the last round of cuts under the Conservative-led coalition government between 2010-15.  The estimate is not the only one circulating among senior officers. An alternative projection suggests the level of officer losses could be higher at 30,000 in the next five years across the 43 police forces in England and Wales.  Last month there was controversy after Sara Thornton, the chair of the body representing police chiefs, said a police officer may not attend every burglary. Police sources privately argue that the public does not accept rationing in policing.  Police chiefs say policing will change, even more so if higher cuts in the next five years approaching 40% are imposed, because there are no longer any easy efficiency savings to make.  The cuts faced from 2010-15 were met by efficiency savings, selling buildings, and losing civilian staff. Privately, police chiefs accept that in 2010 they were able to do without 12% of the budget and they had got used to times of relative financial plenty under Labour. However, they argue that the era of cuts without impact on the service have long gone.  In 2010 when the cuts started there were 143,734 full-time police officers, as well as 16,900 police community support officers PCSOs, and 83,000 civilian staff. Now there are 125,000 police officers, and in total 35,000 staff and officers lost from 2010-15.  The small Sussex force, which dealt with the Shoreham air crash, is planning to lose at least a further 500 officers. Matt Webb, chair of the Sussex police federation, which represents rank and file officers, said: “We stripped back other costs last time. To keep making these savings at some point you have to reduce staff costs.”  He said Sussex police was considering reducing or ending its response to low-level incidents such as shoplifting where little is alleged to be stolen, and non-residential burglaries targeting businesses or storage units. West Midlands police, the second biggest force, estimates it will have nearly halved in size in a decade, down from 14,000 total staff in 2010 to 8,000 in 2020, again assuming the lower level of cuts.  Greater Manchester police is expecting a similar reduction in personnel.  Mike Penning, minister for policing, crime, criminal justice and victims said: “Police reform is working. Over the last five years, frontline services have been protected, public confidence in the police has gone up and crime has fallen by more than a quarter, according to the independent crime survey for England and Wales.  “There is no question that the police still have the resources to do their important work. What matters is how officers are deployed, not how many of them there are in total.  “The changes the government have made since 2010 have made it easier for the police to do their job by cutting red tape, scrapping unnecessary targets, and giving forces the discretion to use their professional judgement. Decisions on the operational deployment of resources, such as PCSOs, are matters for chief constables, in association with police and crime commissioners.”    The Conservatives say they have cut the money that policing cost the taxpayer and have also cut crime. The government’s position was set out in a speech that the home secretary, Theresa May, gave to the Police Federation just after the Conservatives won the general election in May.  “We have reformed your pay and pensions, reduced police spending, and yes, there are fewer officers overall,” May said. “But – despite the predictions of the federation, and despite the predictions of the politicians who wanted to sell you a false dream of ever more spending – crime is down by more than a quarter since 2010, according to the independent crime survey for England and Wales.”",partial
2562c7c0,"There's a loophole in Article 50 that lets Britain back into the EU whenever we want In early June, no one knew what Article 50 was. Now, everyone knows: It is the piece of EU law in the Lisbon Treaty that will trigger Britain's exit from the European Union.  We do not know when prime minister Theresa May will formally trigger Article 50. It could come as soon as this year, or 10 years from now. Almost everyone assumes that once the UK's Article 50 request is made, that's it. We're out. No going back.  But ... there is a little-known loophole in Article 50 that would keep the UK in the EU even after the request is triggered. Basically, the UK can change its mind after the Article 50 request is made as long as no final agreement on Brexit has been reached.  First, this is the text of Article 50:  A Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention. In the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union. That agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with Article 2183 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It shall be concluded on behalf of the Union by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.  Any country making an Article 50 request has two years to reach a pact with the EU. After that, you're out. So as a matter of logistics, the UK is not likely to trigger Article 50 until after it has secured an exit deal to the government's liking. That could take a long time.  But even if that happens, Article 50 still lets us back in.  Most people mistakenly think that the only way back into the EU is through an Article 49 request. Any country wishing to join the EU must go through Article 49 -- it is the standard process for all new countries, and it takes years. The UK would be at the back of that line. Article 50 even mentions this process, which is why so many people think it is the only way back. It says: If a State which has withdrawn from the Union asks to rejoin, its request shall be subject to the procedure referred to in Article 49.  But the House of Lords did the UK a favour and asked for legal advice on the specific question of whether Britain can change its mind. The advice came from Sir David Edward KCMG, QC, PC, FRSE, a former Judge of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Professor Emeritus at the School of Law, University of Edinburgh; and Professor Derrick Wyatt QC, Emeritus Professor of Law, Oxford University, and also of Brick Court Chambers.

Read our privacy notice Thanks for signing up to the News newsletter {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our privacy notice  Here is what their advice said:  Can a Member State's decision to withdraw be reversed?  We asked our witnesses whether it was possible to reverse a decision to withdraw. Both agreed that a Member State could legally reverse a decision to withdraw from the EU at any point before the date on which the withdrawal agreement took effect. Once the withdrawal agreement had taken effect, however, withdrawal was final. Sir David told us: It is absolutely clear that you cannot be forced to go through with it if you do not want to: for example, if there is a change of Government. Professor Wyatt supported this view with the following legal analysis:  There is nothing in the wording to say that you cannot. It is in accord with the general aims of the Treaties that people stay in rather than rush out of the exit door. There is also the specific provision in Article 50 to the effect that, if a State withdraws, it has to apply to rejoin de novo. That only applies once you have left. If you could not change your mind after a year of thinking about it, but before you had withdrawn, you would then have to wait another year, withdraw and then apply to join again. That just does not make sense. Analysis of the text suggests that you are entitled to change your mind.  ... There is nothing in Article 50 formally to prevent a Member State from reversing its decision to withdraw in the course of the withdrawal negotiations. The political consequences of such a change of mind would, though, be substantial.  So, to sum up, even if the UK triggers Article 50 we can still cancel that decision if, for instance, there was a change of government. But the government would be up against the clock: It would have to make that U-turn before the rest of the EU voted on the Article 50 request, and before the two-year deadline elapsed.  Given how long the exit process is likely to take, and how unpredictable UK politics has suddenly become, don't rule out a change of government or a change of heart.

ffba0bf9,"Net migration to UK falls by 49,000 Net migration to the UK has dropped to 273,000 in the year to September, down 49,000 from the previous year.  The Office for National Statistics said it was the first time in two years the balance of people arriving and leaving the UK had dipped below 300,000.  But it is short of the government's aim of an annual figure below 100,000.  Immigration was estimated to be 596,000 - comprising 268,000 EU citizens, 257,000 non-EU citizens and 71,000 British citizens.  This included the highest level ever recorded of Romanians and Bulgarians - 74,000.  Some 323,000 people are thought to have left the UK in the year to September, up by 26,000 on the 12 months to September 2015.  Of these, 128,000 were British citizens, along with 103,000 EU citizens and 93,000 non-EU citizens. line Analysis By Dominic Casciani, home affairs correspondent  Net migration is down. But while the net decrease looks substantial, nobody can say for sure what's triggered the change because these quarterly figures could have been influenced by a string of short-term factors.  For a start, there appears to have been a rise in emigration - and when that goes up, net migration can come down.  Secondly, some of the change could be down to seasonal fluctuations in student numbers.  Thirdly, although there were significant departures by people from some parts of Eastern Europe, the number coming from poorer Romania and Bulgaria went up.  The upshot is the overall number of people arriving for a job is broadly the same. What does it all amount to? Immigration statistics are an inexact science - and at the moment it's very difficult to know for sure what's going on. line  The figures are the first to include migration estimates following the EU referendum in June.  Nicola White, head of international migration statistics at the ONS, said it was too early to say what effect the referendum has had on long-term migration.  Home Secretary Amber Rudd accepted the government was still far from reaching its net migration target, but said the figures demonstrated we can reduce immigration where we can control it.  She denied a rise in people going back to countries such as Poland reflected an uncertainty among EU citizens living in the UK over their futures.  Ms Rudd said: At the moment we have open immigration with the EU members, freedom of movement, so they can come and go as they want.  I don't see any particularly significant change within EU migration. The real change will be when we leave the EU, and then we will be able to make the choices ourselves what level of immigration we want to have.  And she said that Britain remained open to EU citizens already living here and contributing to the economy, saying: Let's not be in any doubt that the UK will always be a welcoming place for people who want to come here, work here and contribute to our economy.  Sunder Katwala, director of the think-tank British Future, said the figures showed the immigration debate will have to move on in the light of Brexit.  He said: A one-size-fits-all approach to immigration can't help us make the post-Brexit choices that the government and the public now face. Graph of Office for National Statistics data on migration Citizenship levels  Meanwhile, separate figures from the Home Office show that a near-record number of EU nationals were granted British citizenship last year.  Citizenship was given to 16,754 people from EU countries, the second highest since records were first compiled, behind the 17,645 in 2013.  Some 6,498 members of the EU 14 countries - older member states such as France, Spain and Germany - were granted UK citizenship in 2016, up 50% on the previous 12 months and the highest ever for a single year.  A further 6,813 people from the EU 8 countries, which include Poland, gained British citizenship, a rise of 18%, surpassed only by figures for 2013.  Citizenship was given to 3,215 Romanians and Bulgarians, up 20% on 2015 and again only topped by 2013 figures.  Other points within the ONS statistics were:      A fall of 10,000 in people coming to the UK from eight Eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2004, to 58,000     Emigration from the UK of people from these countries was up by 12,000 from September 2015 to 39,000, the highest level in five years     The number of non-EU citizens from Africa, the Americas and Oceania leaving the UK increased by 11,000, to 39,000     The 134,000 people coming to the UK to study was a marked decreased, down by 41,000 from September 2015.

f2a01c39,"Budget 2017: National Insurance rate rise criticised Rises in National Insurance Contributions NICS for self-employed workers have been criticised as penalising entrepreneurs.  Chancellor Philip Hammond announced in the Budget that the rate for Class 4 NICS would rise from 9% to 10% in April 2018, and to 11% in 2019.  That compares to 12% currently paid by employees.  The difference in National Insurance Contributions is no longer justified, Mr Hammond said.  Self-employed people have traditionally paid lower NICS than employees, as they receive fewer state benefits.  But the chancellor said the self-employed now had equal access to the new state pension. He also said that the government would consult on parental benefits, some of which self-employed people cannot claim.  The chancellor said all self-employed people who earned less than £16,250 would be better off.  Around half of the 4.8 million workers registered as self-employed earn less than £13,000, according to the think tank the Resolution Foundation.  As a result it said most such workers - such as low-paid hairdressers - will be better off by 2019/20. line Winners and Losers hairdresserimage copyrightGetty Images      A self-employed hairdresser - with average earnings of £12,700 - will be £70 better off       A self-employed taxi driver - with average earnings of £17,300 - will be £20 worse off      A self-employed management consultant - with average earnings of £51,100 - will be £620 worse off.  source: Resolution Foundation line  But the rise, which will cost those affected an average of 60p a week, was criticised by entrepreneurs.  Increasing National Insurance rates for the self-employed could be a further step by the government to penalise those who are taking risks and starting a business, said Lucy-Rose Walker, the chief executive of Entrepreneurial Spark.  Others said it was unfair that the self-employed would have to pay more, when they do not receive the same level of state benefits.  Self-employees are subject to a lower national insurance contribution because they do not receive the same entitlements and benefits as their employed counterparts - such as holiday and sick leave, said Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of tax at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.

Under Class 2 NICS, self-employed workers pay 2% on qualifying earnings between £5,965 and £8060, amounting to £2.80 a week.  The increase in the NICS rate will raise £145m a year for the Treasury by 2021-22.  Matthew Taylor, head of the Royal Society of Arts, is due to produce a report on how the self-employed are taxed later this year.  He has already said that the Treasury is missing out on millions of pounds, as a result of the workers who have been designated as self-employed.  ",other
e5a08193,"Workplace reforms 'will protect gig economy workers' Image copyright Getty Images  Workers on zero-hour contracts, agency employees or gig economy workers are to be better protected by a package of workplace reforms, the government says.  Under new legislation to be introduced on Monday, staff would have to be told details of their rights from their first day in a job, including eligibility for paid and sick leave.  Workers would also be given the right to request more predictable hours.  But Labour and the unions say the planned reforms do not go far enough.  The reforms are based on the findings of a review into modern working practices led by Matthew Taylor, a former aide to ex-PM Tony Blair and chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts.  Ministers say the new legislation will:  close a loophole that had allowed agency staff to be paid less than permanent employees  ensure firms will have to provide a statement of rights on the first day of a person's employment, setting out what paid leave they are entitled to, including for illness, maternity and paternity leave  increase the maximum fine employers face at a tribunal from £5,000 to £20,000, if they are found to have demonstrated malice, spite or gross oversight  ensure that companies will have to calculate holiday pay based on 52 weeks, as opposed to 12 weeks, so people in seasonal or atypical roles get the paid time off they are entitled to  Business Secretary Greg Clark said: Today's largest upgrade in workers' rights in over a generation is a key part of building a labour market that continues to reward people for hard work, that celebrates good employers and is boosting productivity and earning potential across the UK.  However, Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: The right to request guaranteed working hours is no right all.  Zero-hours contract workers will have no more leverage than Oliver Twist.   Unless unions get the right to organise and bargain for workers in places like Uber and Amazon, too many working people will continue to be treated like disposable labour, she added.  Image copyright Getty Images  Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director at the CBI, said: [Businesses] welcome a new law giving all workers the right to request more predictable working hours, which will help to facilitate the conversations that are essential to ensuring flexibility benefits both parties.  But he said: Legislation to amend employment status rules risks making the law less able to adapt to new forms of work in the future.  The government agrees with the Taylor review that completely banning zero-hour contracts would negatively impact more people than it helped.  It also said that platform-based working - including the likes of ride-sharing app Uber or food delivery business Deliveroo - offers genuine two-way flexibility for firms and workers.

8761c91b,"Green Party Leader Natalie Bennett Hits Out At Ofcom's Election Debate Verdict Nick Ansell/PA Wire File photo dated 15/12/14 of Leader of the Green Party of England and Wales Natalie Bennett, who has denied claims that she said being poor in India was not as bad as being on benefits in Britain.  Green Party leader Natalie Bennett has said she is deeply disappointed after media regulator Ofcom said it believed the Green party was not important enough to be included in the televised general election debates.  In a consultation released on Thursday, Ofcom said it did not think the Greens qualified as a major party that should be included, however it said Ukip may qualify for major party status in England and Wales”, despite its failure to demonstrate demonstrated significant past electoral support in General Elections”.  The decision is a blow to Bennett's party, as those classed as major parties are allowed at least two party election broadcasts in the run-up to the general election. However, Ofcom could still change its view, as its initial assessment marks the start of a consultation that runs until 5 February.  Bennett reacted with fury to Ofcom's initial judgement in a blog for The Huffington Post UK, writing: Obviously, as leader of the Green Party, I'm deeply disappointed by this decision, but as a voter and citizen I'm also gravely concerned about the possible impact on British democracy if this stance is maintained in the final guidance.  Ofcom is not only ignoring the views of the 275,000 people who signed the petition calling for the Greens to be included in the broadcasters' proposed leaders' debates, but also the evidence that 79% of the public want to see us in those debates and 85% of women.  She went on: I do think we have people in positions of power who have very fixed ideas about what politics looks and sounds like, think that it's a basically an unchanging wrestle between the traditional big two, with a couple of satellites that squeeze into the gaps without really saying anything different.  When you put together the support for the Green Parties of England and Wales, and Scotland, and Northern Ireland, with those for the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru, there's very strong backing for an anti-austerity alternative to the Coalition-Labour approach, as Nicola Sturgeon, Leanne Wood and I pointed out last month.  This comes after Labour frontbencher Sadiq Khan backed calls for the Greens to be included in the election debates, telling the New Statesman: What the British public deserve to see is all the leaders, and that includes Natalie Bennett, by the way, having a debate about their vision for the country, their analysis of the last five years, an explanation from Cameron and Clegg how the deficit is still £200bn more than they predicted.  Ofcom's decision has raised eyebrows as the Greens have already started to post better poll ratings than the Lib Dems.  Research for Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft put the party on a new high of 8% - up three points - and just ahead of the Lib Dems on 7%.",partial
62b8396b,"Most secondary schools 'use teachers not trained in their subject' Pupils in most secondary schools are being taught by staff not trained in the subject they are teaching, according to a new report.  A survey of 885 schools by the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents secondary school heads, reveals 73 per cent were having to put teachers not trained in the subject they were teaching in front of classes. In addition, 84 per cent said that teacher shortages were having a detrimental effect on the education they were providing.  The subject areas worst hit by what has been described by ASCL president Allan Foulds as a “national crisis” are maths where 78 per of schools are having to make do with staff not trained in the subject, science 75 per cent and English 57 per cent.  Other problem areas are languages with 33 per cent of schools using non-specialist teachers, geography 25 per cent and history 14 per cent. In all, 89 per cent said they were experiencing difficulties in recruiting teachers.  Last month, the National Audit Office revealed that the Department for Education has failed to meet its recruitment targets for trainee teachers for the past four years. The Chief Inspector of Schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, also warned last week of a “brain drain” as teachers opt for jobs in satellite schools abroad, set up by many of the country’s leading independent schools.  The survey coincides with the ASCL’s annual conference this weekend, at which the Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, is expected to be put under pressure to take action on teacher shortages.  “Teacher shortages leave schools with no option other than to use stop-gap solutions,” said Malcolm Trobe, ASCL general secretary. “Supply staff and non-specialists often do a good job in difficult circumstances, but it is no substitute for having permanent teachers who are experts in their subjects.”  Please enter your email address Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP Thanks for signing up to the News newsletter {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

d462dc8d,"Addicts and alcoholics cost us £10billion a year, says Duncan Smith A blitz on helping people with drink, drug and other problems find work is to be launched after it emerged they cost the taxpayer £10 billion a year.  Iain Duncan Smith revealed the figure yesterday as he promised a jobcentre scheme to identify the addictions which are stopping claimants find work.  Under the Universal Support regime, officials will take personal charge of each case to ensure they get treatment, mental health counselling and other support.  Iain Duncan Smith said it costs the taxpayer £10.1billion a year to support people addicted to drugs file photo  Once people have found a job, they will remain under the care of the jobcentre until they are doing sufficient hours to leave the accompanying Universal Credit benefits regime altogether.  The work and pensions secretary said the aim was to find jobs for people who had been ‘parked’ on a life on benefits by the last government.  Mr Duncan Smith added: ‘Too often in the past, people with complex barriers such as addiction, indebtedness or homelessness were written off to a life on benefits.  'Through Universal Support we are putting an end to this, and offering wraparound support for those that need it.  ‘These problems are the root causes of poverty – and if not tackled mean that the cycle of disadvantage will continue into the next generation.’  He pointed to a devastating report by the Lankelly Chase Foundation which found the wider cost to the taxpayer of supporting people with the most severe problems was £10.1 billion a year.  Mr Duncan Smith, pictured, has faced fierce criticism from the Church for his welfare reforms  There are 586,000 people categorised as having at least one serious problem – such as addiction to drink or drugs or homelessness.  Officials said the aim was to reduce the cost of social breakdown by addressing all the ‘barriers’ they face to getting on in life and finding a job.  One said: ‘This is not about cutting benefits – it is about reducing the need.’  Mr Duncan Smith revealed that, for the first time, the Department of Health had acknowledged that having a job improved a person’s health and well-being.  The new policy will allow people who claim mental health problems are preventing them from finding work to access more support.  In about 60 per cent of cases, the problem they have is anxiety or depression.  Help will also be available for people who have problems with housing, childcare, debt and a history of offending.  Mr Duncan Smith has faced fierce criticism from the Church and critics on the Left for his welfare reforms, which they claimed would create ‘unacceptable’ suffering.  But, following a raft of changes to the benefits system designed to incentivise work, the number of children growing up in homes in which nobody has a job has plummeted by 478,000.  The overall number of households where no one was in work fell to the lowest on record in 2015 – almost 700,000 fewer than in 2010.",other
0adec63d,"Local NHS allocated £570 billion to fund the NHS Long Term Plan Local health services today are being allocated £570 billion to fund NHS services and implement the new long term plan.  Every area in England will receive a cash increase of at least 17% over the next five years, including a minimum rise of 4.4% next year.  Some £1 billion a year will be distributed according to the greatest need, with a redeveloped fairer funding formula channelling extra money to places with the highest rates of early death and unmet health needs.  Other changes will mean more investment from April targeted at areas with higher needs for community services for the first time and give greater regard to need for mental health services.  The allocation of funding for local Clinical Commissioning Groups follows publication of the NHS Long Term Plan setting out the priorities of the health service over the next decade.  NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: “This funding backs delivery of the NHS long term plan in every part of England for the next five years.  “It will fund cutting edge treatments such as genome tests for every child with cancer, build up community services to provide more joined up care while taking pressure off hospitals and address the unmet need for mental health services.  “Tackling health inequalities in our society is not just about fairness but is a matter of hard-headed economics which will not only save lives but also save taxpayers’ money and NHS staff time.  “The public can be confident that the NHS will make every penny count, with data published by the Office for National Statistics yesterday showing productivity for health services in England grew by 3% in 2016/17, over three times the growth for the wider UK economy in that year.”  Under the new fairer funding formula two of the areas with the worst rates for premature deaths, Blackpool and Bradford City, will receive increases of 11% and 13% respectively next year alone meaning they have £40 million and £26 million more to invest.  The NHS Long Term Plan, unveiled on Monday, will save an estimated 85,000 more lives each year through earlier detection of killer conditions such as cancer and heart problems and a renewed focus on prevention.  The measures will help prevent 150,000 heart attacks, strokes and dementia cases while more than three million people will benefit from new and improved stroke, respiratory and cardiac services over the next decade.  There is also a new, historic guarantee that investment in primary, community and mental health care will grow faster than the growing overall NHS budget.  This will fund a £4.5 billion new service model for the 21st century across England, where health bodies come together to provide better, joined up care in partnership with local government.  The measures to tackle major physical conditions comes alongside the biggest ever investment in mental health services rising to at least £2.3 billion a year by 2023/24.",fake
98e344da,"Human rights laws cost Britain £42 bn in rulings and payouts Human rights laws cost Britain £42bn in rulings and payouts    Membership of the European Court of Human Rights has cost UK taxpayers more than £42billion, according to a report.    The bill for complying with its judgments has seen money thrown at litigation and diverted from essential services, it is claimed.    The court, based in Strasbourg, France, has even forced Parliament to overturn a number of UK laws. It even made the government give prisoners the vote – despite strong opposition from ministers and the public.    Law and Order: The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, where membership is costing Britain billions    The court rules on cases brought against countries that have signed the European Convention on Human Rights, a code drawn up in the light of Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism.    The study into how much the convention and its court cost Britain, which became a signatory in 1950, was carried out by the TaxPayers’ Alliance.    Dr Lee Rotherham, author of the report, said: ‘Fifty years on from the days of Stalin and Hitler, the Strasbourg court is no longer needed to protect us from a knock on the door at 3am, or being deported with a handcart. It carries an increasingly political agenda that is running roughshod over our laws and our courts, at major costs to the taxpayer and to business.    ‘In the homeland of Magna Carta, you would hope that politicians and human rights lawyers might have more self confidence. Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States get by very well without joining up to continental human rights courts. Britain can too.’  Controversial rulings include a transsexual serving time for manslaughter and attempted rape being allowed to move to a woman’s prison even though he committed the offences while a man. The court has also prevented the deportation of foreigners found guilty of serious offences.    The UK lost its first case at the court – which is independent from the EU – in 1975 and had to pay out its first damages in 1980. The report suggested that Britain has lost more than three quarters – 331 out of 418 – of cases heard in Strasbourg.    Labour’s Human Rights Act of 1998 was supposed to reduce the number of appeals to Europe by applying Strasbourg principles in British courts. The rate of lost cases has worsened however.    The cost of complying with judgments under the convention is £17.3billion to date, the report said. In addition, the growth of a compensation culture fostered by the court has added a further £25billion in costs.    Sian Herbert, of the think tank Open Europe, said: ‘The ECHR and the European Court of Justice [which rules on EU law] now act as a de facto supreme court in the UK in many ways.    ‘While we need to remain a country committed to strong protection of basic liberties and rights, these two bodies lack the democratic and judicial legitimacy to fulfil this duty.’",fake

It marks a huge leap forward in this news­paper’s crusade to get Britain out of the EU. Some 14,581 people voted – 11,706 of them want the UK to quit compared with 2,725 who want to remain part of the EU. The mini-referendum – the first on the issue since 1975 – was organised by two senior Tory backbenchers and a prospective Tory MP. They believe the overwhelming result, which will be presented to David Cameron today, will force him to bring forward his planned in-or-out vote on the UK’s future in Europe to next year instead of 2017. The landslide result heaps further pressure on the Prime Minister to act as it comes just days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker compared British membership of the EU to a doomed romance and suggested it was time for Britain to get a divorce. The Tory poll was organised across three neighbouring parliamentary constituencies by Peter Bone, MP for Wellingborough, Philip Hollobone, MP for Kettering, and Tom Pursglove, who is standing as Tory candidate for Corby and East Northamptonshire at this year’s general election.  GETTY The results of the poll confirm that an in-or-out referendum is necessary in 2017, if not earlier  Following the count, carried out in the London offices of the Daily Express yesterday, Mr Bone said: “Eight out of 10 people who took part want to come out of Europe – that is extraordinary. It is very, very, very clear they want to come out.” The turnout, he added, shows there is a “huge interest” in having a nationwide referendum. “People actually bothering to put X on a ballot paper clearly shows that people have been bothered to take part in a referendum and there is a huge interest in it,” he added. “Only the Conservatives will give us the referendum. Ukip can’t and Labour and the Lib Dems won’t.” Mr Hollobone said he expected the result would be reflected nationwide. “My gut feeling is that there would be a majority of people voting to leave across the country,” he said. “Maybe not on the scale we have seen in North Northamptonshire but a majority nevertheless.

c142d136,"The Queen Has Paid For The Palace Many Times Over At the time of writing, over one hundred thousand people had succumbed to the latest convulsion of faux outrage by signing a petition demanding that the Royal Family pays for Palace renovation. This refers to the recent decision by the Government to increase the payment allocated to the Royal Family via the Sovereign Grant to cover the £369 million cost of repairing Buckingham Palace, with no major renovation works having been carried out on the vital arteries of the Palace since the Second World War.  The issue with this petition is that it is either completely ignorant of how the Royal Family receives its income and how much is given to the state, or it has deliberately glossed over the facts in favour of pushing some nice easy click bait. So I'll try and present the facts that have been omitted from this petition in an attempt to set the record straight.  First and foremost, Buckingham Palace isn't actually a private residence that is owned by the Queen, or any other Monarch that resides in it. It is the property of the Crown Estate, which is required to give all of its revenue to HM Treasury. The Monarch of the day is allowed to reside in the Palace, but is also obliged to play host to hundreds of state functions every year and has been used by the Government on countless occasions as part of its strategy of soft diplomacy when looking to woo foreign leaders.  Secondly, the petition ignores the fact that the Crown Estate has already paid for the renovation many times over by way of their contributions to Government revenue. In fact, they've already paid for it six times over in the last ten years alone having paid £2.4 billion to the Treasury over that period. That's money that's gone towards paying for the NHS, schools and emergency services. In the last year alone, they handed over £304.1 million to the Exchequer.  Although the Monarch does receive some money back from the Crown Estate profits, this has been set at 15% of the profits of the Crown Estate by way of the Sovereign Grant. In other words, it is the equivalent to you or I handing over 85% of our income in taxes. But even then, the Sovereign Grant is expected to cover the cost of all official business carried out by the Queen, often on behalf of the Government you and I elect.  There should be no doubt that this work on the Palace is essential, but the key thing is that the Crown Estate will have handed over enough profit to the Government in less than two years to fully cover the cost of this necessary but temporary increase in the Sovereign Grant.  Let's get off the back of our Queen and instead take pride in the fact the Crown Estate generates so much revenue for our vital public services every year and that this fantastic British building will be preserved for future generations- and Governments- to reap the benefits of its grandeur.",partial

Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  The state pension age is set to rise to 75 over the next 16 years — based on a plan by new PM Boris Johnson ’s favourite think tank.  It would go up to 70 just nine years from now as the change is phased in.  A report by the Centre for Social Justice says Britain can no longer afford the current plan to raise the pension age to 67 in 2028 then 68 by 2046, so it must be speeded up.  The pensions bill has ballooned from £17billion in 1989 to £92billion now, making up £4 of every £10 of welfare spending, the report adds.  By 2023 it will cost £20billion more as the population ages and the birthrate falls.  It proposes raising the eligible age to 70 by 2028 and 75 by 2035.  Image: Reuters  The first people likely to be affected by such a change are those born between March 6, 1961 and April 5, 1977.  Welfare campaigners are appalled by the report and point out that with workplace pensions often unaffordable, three-quarters of Britain’s elderly will rely entirely on their state payments by 2036.  Ex-pensions minister Ros Altmann added: “This might be a great way to save public money but will cause a lot of hardship.  There are huge differences in life expectancy across Britain. There must be a facility for those who can’t work to retire earlier.”  Image: PA  And Jan Shortt of the National Pensioners Convention added: “The longer you work the more ill you become and the less likely you are to even reach retirement age.”  The Centre for Social Justice is chaired by ex-Welfare Secretary and Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith and Tory governments get many of their ideas from it.  In 2009 it dreamed up Universal Credit , adopted as policy by PM David Cameron a year later.  Its boss Andy Cook insists: “Working longer potentially improves health and wellbeing– we don’t do enough to help older people stay in work.  The state pension doesn’t reflect healthy working life expectancy.”  Image: Getty  The report also claims that a million pension-age Britons want to work, but can’t find bosses who will employ them.  It suggests a system of “mid-life MOTs” for older staff, leading to flexible hours and special training for those who stay in work.”  A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: “Everyone’s State Pension age is unique to them and in 2017 we raised the future retirement age to 68 so that it is sustainable now and for future generations.  We’re creating opportunities for people of all generations with record employment.”",fake
c38d575e,"Plastic straws, cotton buds and drink stirrers to be banned in England Plastic straws and drink stirrers, and cotton buds with plastic stems will be banned from sale and use in England from next April, the government has confirmed.  The move, which has been in the offing for more than a year, is hoped to vastly reduce the litter and other environmental impacts of the nearly 5bn plastic straws currently used each year in England, along with more than 300m plastic stirrers and close to 2bn cotton buds with plastic stems.  Huge numbers of these items, particularly cotton buds, are flushed down toilets or otherwise end up in litter – surveys have recently found waterways across the UK teeming with plastic, putting wildlife at risk.  Alternatives are available, including serving drinks without straws or stirrers, which is preferable, or using paper straws and biodegradable products in place of plastic stirrers and cotton buds. The only exceptions to the new rule will be for people with a medical need or disability, for whom plastic straws and other materials will be available upon request.  The EU is also moving to phase out plastics in various forms.  A government consultation found that more than 80% of respondents supported a ban on the distribution and sale of plastic straws, while nine out of 10 people wanted a ban on drink stirrers, and a similar number supported a ban on plastic-handled cotton buds.  Registered pharmacies will be permitted to sell plastic straws, over the counter or online, but restaurants, pubs and other catering establishments will not be allowed to display plastic straws or provide them automatically.  Michael Gove, the environment secretary, said: “Urgent and decisive action is needed to tackle plastic pollution. These items are often used for just a few minutes, but take hundreds of years to break down.”  Campaigners welcomed the government’s move. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of Surfers Against Sewage, which campaigns against plastic pollution, said: “Stopping the production and distribution of these single-use plastic menaces will prevent them from polluting beaches nationwide. It’s a really positive and bold step in the right direction against plastic pollution.”  However, the items expected to be banned were only part of the plastic problem, said Emma Priestland, campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “These three items are just a fraction of the single-use nasties that are used for a tiny amount of time before polluting the environment for centuries to come,” she said.  “Ultimately, we need producers to take responsibility for the plastic pollution caused by all their products, whether it’s bags, balloons, packets, containers or otherwise. That’s why we’re campaigning for legislation to cut back on pointless plastic across the board.”",fake
7b9e930d,"Britain's cocaine use doubles in last seven years as one in 50 Londoners snorts the drug daily The use of cocaine in Britain has doubled in seven years, as one in 50 Londoners currently snorts the drug daily.  An analysis of Britain's waste water, carried out by forensic scientists at King's College London, has also proved that the purity of the class A drug has gone up, hitting a record high.  Tests of the drug in sewage show Londoners are taking almost 200,000 doses of cocaine every day, which amounts to about £700,000.  The research found that one in 50 Londoners currently takes the drug on a daily basis  Concentrations in waste water are 900 milligrams per 1,000 of the population per day, which rose from 392 milligrams per 1,000 in 2011.  The average cocaine dose through smoking or snorting is 40 milligrams, meaning that, in a population of nine million people, one in 50 is taking the class A drug on a daily basis.  The research also found out that the use of cocaine in London is almost as high during weekdays as it is at the weekend.  The use of cocaine in London is almost as high during the week as it is at the weekend  Last year, the Global Drug Survey reported that the British capital is one of cities in the world where cocaine can be delivered faster than pizza, thanks to the use of smartphones and encrypted messaging services.  London, Bristol, Barcelona, Antwerp, Zurich and Amsterdam are considered the top cities in Europe for the use of cocaine.  A study carried out by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in 2015 found that London was the city with the highest concentration of cocaine in its sewage in Europe.  Cocaine purity is soaring thanks to the increased supply and production in Latin America  Traces of the drug have been found in fish and shrimps in Suffolk.  A study published last summer found that endangered eels could become 'hyperactive' because of the presence of drugs in Britain's waters.  Biologists at the University of Naples Federico II also found that the the drugs accumulate in the animals' brains, muscles, gills and skin.  Dr Leon Barron, who led the latest analysis at King's College London, said the purity of cocaine has also risen through the increased supply and production in Latin America.  Recent research by the National Crime Agency confirmed cocaine purity is at 'historically high levels'.  Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, said cocaine users often fuel gang violence and knife crime.  Pure cocaine is sold for about £100 per gram on the street.  Cocaine seizures have trebled in five hears, from 42.8 tons in 2013-14 to 122.9 tons in 2017-18, The Telegraph reported.  Dr Barron said treating sewage can remove most of the cocaine from waste water before it is recycled into rivers.",other

A study by the Action for Rail campaign showed that season tickets and other regulated fares had increased by 25% since 2010, while average pay went up by 9%.  Government plans to cap annual rises in regulated fares will cost taxpayers around £700 million over the next five years, but bigger savings could be passed on to passengers if train services were run by the public sector, said the report.  Season tickets could be 10% cheaper by 2017 if routes coming up for tender were given to public sector organisations, it was claimed.  TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “Rail fares have rocketed over the last five years leaving many commuters seriously out of pocket.  “If ministers really want to help hard-pressed commuters they need to return services to the public sector. This is a fair, more sustainable option and it would allow much bigger savings to be passed on to passengers. Introducing an arbitrary cap on fares is simply passing the bill on to taxpayers.  Image: PA  “The Government wants the public to subsidise train companies’ profits and bear the cost of the fares cap.”  Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said: “Once more, those who claim they want to make work pay devalue that statement with continual, excessive and unreasonable increases in fares.”  Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: “While train companies threaten to throw guards off their services and axe station staff who are essential for safety, turning the network into a paradise for criminals and yobs, they are milking the travelling public for all they can through extortionate fares.  “Every penny of the fare rip-off is sucked out of the system in fat company profits, while crucial rail maintenance and upgrade works are shelved for lack of funds.  “That’s the price of two decades of rail privatisation and the whole rotten business needs to be swept away and replaced by a public railway under public control.”  TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes said: “We have the most expensive rail fares in Europe and they have risen by over 200% on the most popular routes since privatisation 20 years ago.  “We should follow the European example and run a publicly owned railway for the benefit of the travelling public, not the private rail firms.”",truth

d917caca,"Be warned driving in flip flops can land you £5000 fine, 9 points and a ban! Wearing shoes that are too loose can be dangerous as they can impact the way you control your motor vehicle.  As the weather gets warmer us Brits get out our flip flops.  But those of us who choose to drive in their summer shoes could find themselves in trouble if they're involved in an accident.  Driving in flip flops is not illegal but wearing them could lead to a careless driving charge if they impact your ability to drive safely.  Under Rule 97 of the Highway Code, drivers are advised they must have footwear and clothing which does not prevent you using the controls in the correct manner.  Flip flops could slip off your foot, become wedged under pedals or prevent you from pressing the pedals with enough force to brake quickly, which could cause you to drive erratically or even lead to a crash.  If you get stopped by police while driving in a dangerous manner or your footwear is a reason for an accident, you could be charged with driving without due care and attention careless driving.  The careless driving fine carries a £100 on-the-spot fine and three penalty points on your licence.  If a more serious case, or it gets contested in court, the charge can attract a maximum £5,000 fine, up to nine penalty points and even a court-imposed driving ban.  A study by insurance brand ingenie previously found a huge 27 per cent of motorists could be risking this penalty as they wear flip flops behind the wheel.  RAC's guidelines for suitable driving footwear According to the RAC there are some guidelines for what footwear is suitable when driving: Have a sole no thicker than 10mm, but the sole should not be too thin or soft.  Provide enough grip to stop your foot slipping off the pedals.  Not be too heavy.  Not limit ankle movement.  Be narrow enough to avoid accidentally depressing two pedals at once.  Neil Greig, IAM RoadSmart Director of Policy and Research, told Sun Motors: “Before setting off, you should ensure that clothing and footwear do not prevent you using the controls in the correct manner.  “If flip flops stopped you being in control you could be prosecuted, as you are breaking Highway Code Rule 97.  Careless driving is mostly judged on the impact your driving has on others around you, so if you are spotted swerving or braking erratically and then stopped and found to have inadequate footwear, you could be prosecuted.  If you do cause a crash, then it could also be an aggravating factor against you in court and lead to a slightly higher fine or longer ban.”    Make sure you wear the correct footwear to drive this summer.",partial

New analysis by Labour of ONS figures released on Tuesday has revealed that a staggering 100,000 retail jobs have been lost in stores across Britain since 2015, as real wages have stagnated and the Government’s botched handling of the Brexit negotiations has hit consumer and business confidence.  Along with reform to the business rates system to ease the burden on traditional high streets and town centres, Rebecca Long Bailey, Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary, has called on the Government to consider:  Establishing a register of landlords of empty shops in each local authority, to make it easier to bring boarded up shops back into use  Launching an inquiry into excessive car parking charges levied by private firms, to examine the benefits of promoting free parking in city centres  2018 has seen numerous major high street brands fall into administration or announce store closures, including House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer, Mothercare and New Look. Research by the British Retail Consortium has revealed nearly a fifth of British retailers are planning to cut the number of people they employ in the next three months.  A report by PwC and the Local Data Company found that last year 4,000 High Street shops opened and 5,800 closed, a net loss of 1,800. Currently 11.35% of shops are empty, and the Local Data Company has found that 52% of former BHS stores still lie empty 2 years after the final closure.  Research by XLN last year found nine in ten people would visit high streets more often if free parking was offered. A third of respondents picked expensive parking and the lack of free parking as their biggest high street frustrations.  The British Retail Consortium has reported that 94 per cent of people surveyed say they miss the community feel of their high street.  Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary, said:  “Our high streets are dying but the Government isn’t doing anything about it.  “Losing giants like House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer and New Look from town centres across the country is alarming.  “Our communities, hundreds of thousands of jobs, and our economy, both local and national, depend on thriving high streets. The Tories need to take action fast, before we become a nation of ghost towns.”",fake

Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  MPs from across the political divide have demanded an urgent decision on whether to expand Heathrow or Gatwick airport.  The delay in making a decision over where to build a new runway is costing the UK up to £6m a day, a report by a cross-party Commons body claims.  The British Infrastructure Group BIG, headed by Conservative MP Grant Shapps, urged new prime minister Theresa May to show her mettle by ending the speculation.  Its report entitled Gate Now Closing , which was published on Sunday July 24, calls for an urgent and immediate decision on hub airport expansion.  The report does not state where group thinks a new runway should be built, but it argues that the indecision is having a deleterious effect on Britain's businesses, the economy and jobs.  'Problem of capacity... causing substantial damage'  The problem of capacity at the current hub, Heathrow, is causing substantial damage to the industry as a whole, the report says.  It erodes confidence in the Government's stated ambition of growing the economy and our international trade.  The evidence has been gathered by the Airports Commission. Now a decision is needed, to show the new leadership's mettle.  The Airports Commission last summer recommended building a third runway at Heathrow over a second landing strip at Gatwick.  Still no date for Heathrow announcement  The Government's decision was initially delayed last year when further environmental studies were commissioned , and then in June following the outcome of the EU referendum.  The Department for Transport has not indicated when a decision is likely, following Chris Grayling's appointment as the new transport secretary.  Theresa May's election as prime minister, and the appointment to her cabinet of a number of Heathrow opponents , saw one bookmaker slash the odds on Gatwick winning the battle for a new runway.  Heathrow recently unveiled new images and video footage showing how an expanded airport would look , which it said showed it was ready to begin work as soon as it got the go-ahead.

d8c5eecd,"Relentless' workload forcing 'desperate' teachers to leave profession with big pay cuts Teachers who leave the profession for other jobs are taking substantial pay cuts, a new study published tonight reveals.  The research by the NFER National Foundation for Educational Research looked at teachers who left for different occupations over the past 14 years and found that, on average, their pay dropped by 10 per cent, compared with those who stayed in teaching.  It reveals that some teachers – who left to become teaching assistants or who took up a job in the public sector – saw a drop in their wages of up to 30 per cent.  Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said she knew of a teacher who had become a bus driver because they felt “anything was preferable to the lack of quality of life” that came with teaching.  “The fact that teachers are taking lower paid jobs reflects the desperation that many teachers feel, she said. The relentless nature of the workload and pressure is leading to teachers just walking. They can see no way they can remain in teaching and so they lose professional status and money.”  But the NFER analysis, of the government Labour Force Survey LFS data, can only indicate how the teachers' pay has changed in the short term as the LFS only follows up individuals for one year.  The Should I Stay or Should I Go? report concludes: “The short-term pay benefits from a career move may be limited by the need to prove value to new employers and develop skills for a different career. The prospect of higher pay in the longer-term may still have been a motivation for some teachers who left teaching.”  The report added that it is “possible that career-changers from other professions experience a similar fall in wages and this phenomenon is not likely to be unique to teaching.”  According to the research, more than half 51 per cent of teachers who leave teaching take up jobs in the education sector excluding those who leave to retire.  Carole Willis, NFER chief executive, said: “Recruiting and retaining good quality teachers is a key issue facing the education system over the next five to 10 years. Understanding the types of jobs former teachers are going into and their underlying motivations is crucial for formulating an appropriate policy response.”  The NFER analysed a sample of 6,896 teachers, including 936 who left teaching and 774 who joined teaching, over a 14-year period 2001-2015.

Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  There is no strong evidence that children under ten have passed coronavirus onto adults, researchers have suggested.  Young children do not play a significant role in spreading the virus and are significantly less likely to become infected than adults, according to a review of existing research into Covid-19 and children by the Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health RCPCH said.  It worked with other research teams to examine the correlation in studies of transmission from children to adults after public health officials in Switzerland said today under-10s could finally hug their grandparents again as they pose no risk to them.  The review, by the Don't Forget the Bubbles paediatric research project, stated: Notably, the China/WHO joint commission could not recall episodes during contact tracing where transmission occurred from a child to an adult.  Image: REUTERS  But the review also urged caution as it is still unknown whether children have passed on the virus, particularly given large numbers of asymptomatic cases.  A nine-year-old British boy who contracted coronavirus in a French Alps did not pass it on, despite having contact with more than 170 people at three schools. This case was studied as part of the research.  Dr Alasdair Munro, the clinical research fellow in paediatric infectious diseases who led the research, said: Covid-19 appears to affect children less often, and with less severity, including frequent asymptomatic or sub-clinical infection.  There is evidence of critical illness, but it is rare.  The role of children in transmission is unclear, but it seems likely they do not play a significant role.  Professor Russell Viner, the president of the RCPCH, said: From around the world, we are not seeing evidence that children are involved in spreading or transmitting the virus, but we do not have enough evidence.  Prof Viner added that it was too soon to say children could hug their grandparents, particularly as the over-70s are the most vulnerable.  Note: Children are not believed to play a significant role in the spread of coronavirus. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a study had found no cases of children passing coronavirus to an adult exist.",other
542709000000,"University Applications Fall By 25,000 As Effects Of Brexit And Funding Changes Hit, UCAS Figures Reveal The number of would-be students applying to university has fallen by 25,000 since last year, with experts blaming Brexit and funding changes for the fall. Overall, 649,700 people applied to university by June 30 - the last deadline for applications, down around 4% compared with this point last year. A breakdown shows a 4% decrease in UK applicants, while the number of EU students planning to study at a UK university or college has fallen by 5%, the Press Association reported. However, there has been a 2% rise in international students from countries outside the EU.  FatCamera via Getty Images Applications to UK universities have fallen by 25,000 since 2016  Across the UK, the numbers applying to go into higher education have fallen by 5% in England, 4% in Northern Ireland, 1% in Scotland and 5% in Wales. But the statistics do show that the proportion of 18-year-olds in England applying to universities has reached a new high, with 37.9% planning to study for a degree, up from 37.2% in 2016. Dame Julia Goodfellow, president of vice-chancellors’ group Universities UK, said: “These figures confirm what we know already from UCAS about application figures for this year. There are several possible reasons behind the drop in numbers. “Last year was a record high for applications, and factors such as Brexit and changes to the way degrees in nursing, midwifery and some other allied health professions in England are funded, could also be having an impact. “There has also been a fall in the number of 18 and 19-year-olds across the UK population since 2010. “This group makes up over half of all UK applicants to universities. The rate of applications from this age group, however, is at record levels, highlighting continued demand for university courses.” She added: “We recognise there are a number of issues to address. Continuing to communicate to European applicants that they are welcome and enrich our education system is important. “The decline in part-time and mature student entrants must also be addressed. “We recognise also the concern about the total cost of going to university. Any analysis needs to cover the cost of maintenance and the interest rate on the loans.” The figures come amid a growing debate on the future of tuition fees, which currently stand at a maximum of £9,250 a year, sparked by a Labour General Election pledge to scrap the charges.

Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  Jeremy Corbyn has signed a formal bid to kill off an emergency law denying increased benefits to 150,000 disabled people.  The Labour leader joined Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, SNP MPs, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron and ex-Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to back the motion on its first day in Parliament.  So far 28 MPs have signed the motion, drawn up by the Lib Dems, to stop legal changes to disability benefit Personal Independence Payment PIP.  Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Debbie Abrahams, who has reported the PIP shake-up to the United Nations, has also signed the motion against the law.  Ministers drew up emergency laws to combat two tribunals which said PIP - which funds disabled people's living costs - should be widened.  The tribunals said people who suffer overwhelming psychological distress when they leave home should get more cash.  That includes those with autism, dementia, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress and depression.  Tory MP Heidi Allen warned ministers have a duty to honour the tribunals and the Bow Group, a Tory think tank, said ignoring them gives the Conservative Party a bad name.  Yet the government refused to back down - saying to do so would cost taxpayers £3.7bn by 2022.  And Tory MP Mr Freeman sparked outrage by claiming the bizarre judgements had simply helped people who take pills at home who suffer from anxiety.  Despite the support for the motion it faces a struggle to be accepted - and the last time a similar one succeeded was in 1979.  The legal shake-up is happening via a Statutory Instrument subject to negative resolution, an obscure piece of law that can only be blocked if MPs pray against it.  The law came into effect instantly on February 23, but under Westminster's bizarre system, can be annulled if the House of Commons votes to back a prayer within 40 days and nights.  Labour and the Lib Dems both submitted a formal prayer to Commons authorities today, and the Lib Dems' - which arrived first - was selected for debate.  Being signed by the Leader of the Opposition makes a prayer more likely to be considered for debate.  But they are still not always guaranteed time in the Commons, even if there is widespread support for them.",partial

Some repeat offenders are being sent to jail for the first time after committing 100 or more different crimes, according to the data.  The numbers – slipped out by ministers this month – suggest that most criminals going to prison have already been convicted of multiple offences in the past.  The i politics newsletter cut through the noise Email address is invalid Thank you for subscribing! Sorry, there was a problem with your subscription.  Conservative MPs claimed the revelation proves the justice system is too soft on offenders, while reformers accused the Government of failing to rehabilitate criminals and relying too much on prisons.  Offences history  In response to a written question from Tory backbencher Philip Davies, the Ministry of Justice said that the average man given a jail sentence of less than six months had committed 56.6 offences resulting in a conviction or caution, while women in the same position had 60.4 previous offences.  The figures also showed that last year, there was one offender who had carried out 93 different crimes before being sent to jail for the first time. In 2018, at least two first-time prisoners had previously been convicted of more than 100 offences.  The data come from the Police National Computer, which covers all police forces across the UK.  Mr Davies, the MP for Shipley, told i: “These figures absolutely destroy the liberal-leftie orthodoxy on the criminal justice system. Before people are given a short prison sentence they are given community sentence after community sentence, and this is proof that community sentences don’t work.”  But Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran argued that the data “expose a systemic failure to rehabilitate those convicted of crimes, and to prevent reoffending”. She added: “It is deeply hypocritical of the Government to talk tough on crime and grandstand on police numbers, whilst also failing to invest in rehabilitation and prevention initiatives.”  Andrew Neilson of the Howard League for Penal reform added: “Sending people to prison for short spells is particularly ineffective, as these figures reveal. Most people serving short prison sentences have done so before, and will almost certainly do so again. It simply isn’t working.”  The Minister of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.",partial

8febabd8,"We Need To Talk About Police Brutality In The U.K. It was the death of Sheku Bayoh in 2015 that spurred me into action: in an attempt to add black British voices to the ongoing story of worldwide police brutality, I’ve teamed up with filmmaker Troy James Aidoo to create the documentary film 1500 And Counting. We have been working with members of the Bayoh family and organizations to put a spotlight on the criminal behaviour of officers, in an attempt to shake British people out of their current state of complacency. If we cannot trust the state to police us fairly, then we are all walking targets. Time and time again, we see a similar pattern in the stories of black victims of police brutality: they are often vulnerable usually suffering from mental illness, arrested by several officers, and brute force is used to detain them.  The making of 1500 And Counting led me to ask what has really changed since the 1980s—a time when skinheads ruled the streets and terrorized immigrants, and now-abolished 'sus' laws allowed police officers to profile black men and boys, searching and brutalizing them for no particular reason. Although the Race Relations Act was initially introduced to outlaw racial discrimination in the U.K. in 1965, and was extended to apply to the police in the ‘90s, not much has improved. If we examine any area of British life, we will see significant racial inequalities. The unemployment rate for ethnic minorities in the U.K. is 11.3%, more than twice that of white people 5.5%. Depressingly, black people are almost three times as likely to be unemployed than anyone else in the U.K., with 38% of young black men currently unemployed compared to 17.8% of young white men. Healthcare is another area where gross inequality exists: Black people are 44% more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act than their white counterparts.  Black people are more disproportionately represented in U.K. prisons than in the U.S. The proportion of black people in jail in the U.K. is almost seven times their share of the population, whereas in the U.S. the proportion of black prisoners is four times greater than their population share. And terrifyingly, police officers have used routine arrests to collect the DNA profile of three-quarters of young black British men between the ages of 18 and 35.",fake

Leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer will visit a hospital in Derby this morning Thursday, as Budget documents revealed a planned cut in day to day spending in the Department of Health and Social Care of £30.1 billion from April this year.  It comes as new analysis published by the Labour Party reveals that:  The number of patients waiting more than 18 weeks for treatment has increased by over 500% over the last decade.  Almost a quarter of a million people are waiting more than a year for treatment.  An estimated 4.59 million people are currently on the waiting list for treatment – the highest ever number on record.  Even before the pandemic hit, the number of people waiting more than 18 weeks had spiralled over the previous nine years, to over 720,000 in December 2019.  Only 68% of patients on the waiting list have been waiting 18 weeks or less – the statutory target for 92% of patients to receive treatment within 18 weeks of referral has not been met since 2016.  The figures include patients waiting for hip and knee replacements and cataract removals, among many other procedures and treatments vital to people’s quality of life.  NHS England spending will fall from £147.7 billion this year to £139.1 billion from next despite the ongoing costs to the NHS from Covid and the huge backlog of cases and waiting lists that have built up during the crisis.  In November, the Health Foundation estimated that clearing the backlogs and reducing waiting times would cost around £2 billion a year over the next three years.  Commenting on the findings, Jonathan Ashworth MP, Shadow Health and Social Care Secretary, said:  “The Chancellor is failing patients, our NHS and its staff by cutting frontline services during a pandemic.  “With lists already at a record high, this will mean patients waiting even longer in pain for vital treatment.  “Yesterday’s Budget papered over the cracks rather than rebuilding the foundations of our country.”",fake

0b9f0803,"Ministers urged to ban fast food outlets from opening near schools Fast food outlets should be banned from opening within 400 metres of schools in England, according to leading child doctors.  The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health urged the government to introduce the measure as part of its updated childhood obesity strategy, published this summer.  The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has suggested a ban on any new fast food outlets being built within such distance and the college called for this to be extended across the UK.  Prof Russell Viner, the president of the college, said ministers should “take a leap of faith” and introduce the measures to make it easier for councils to keep junk food away from students.  In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, he said: “Kids are coming out of school hungry and finding themselves surrounded by cheap chicken shops, chip shops and other types of junk food. This just wasn’t the case 20 or 30 years ago.  “People tend to eat what’s in front of them and we need to make it easier for children to make the right choices.”  Viner said local authorities needed increased powers to make it easier to bring in such bans. A number of councils have introduced these measures, but others said they faced too much red tape.    It comes as data shows that almost a third of children aged two to 15 are overweight or obese and younger generations are becoming obese at earlier ages and staying obese for longer.    In May, the Commons health and social care committee will open hearings for an inquiry on childhood obesity, examining areas that they should take action.  The college also proposed that there be a national programme to weigh and measure children from birth through to their teenage years.

7ffcc643,"At-risk gamblers 'need better protection' The body, which scrutinises public spending on behalf of parliament, called for better protection for at risk gamblers.  It said the government should look at the way the regulator, the Gambling Commission, is funded.  The Commission said it agreed that more needed to be done.  The NAO report said that licensed gambling - excluding the National Lottery - had increased by 57% over the past decade.  Much of this rise, it said, was due to an increase in licensed online gambling, which rose sharply in November 2014 when a change in regulations meant all online gambling needed to be licensed, including firms based overseas.      William Hill site penalised over gambling addicts     The people most likely to have a gambling problem     Gambling links with football have 'gone too far'     Gambling on credit cards to be banned  The Gambling Commission is a small regulator in a huge and fast-evolving industry. While the Commission has made improvements, gambling regulation lags behind the industry, said Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO.  The Commission estimates 1.8 million people are at risk gamblers and 395,000 are problem gamblers, including 55,000 children. Gambling addiction can lead to mental health problems and severe financial difficulties.  A spokesperson for the Gambling Commission said: We agree with the report's assessment that we face the significant challenge of regulating a dynamic and developing industry.  It was already discussing proposals to reform its funding model with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, it added.  The Commission received £19m of funding in 2018-19, almost all of which came from the licence fees charged to operators, the NAO's report said.  The organisation does not have the power to increase the licence fees it charges, making it difficult to invest in new skills to respond to developments in the industry, the watchdog said.  The fees are set through secondary legislation by the government every four years.  ",partial

e91bcd49,"NHS hospital waiting time figures worst in seven years The number and proportion of NHS hospital patients in England waiting more than 18 weeks to begin treatment have risen to their highest levels in almost seven years, official statistics show.  In February, nearly 40,000 admitted patients did not start consultant-led treatment within 18 weeks of referral, and more than 13,000 waited more than 26 weeks. The target is for 90% to receive treatment within 18 weeks but only 87% did so.  The only worse performance – for both percentage and absolute number – since records began in March 2008 was in April of that year when 86.7% began treatment within 18 weeks. That meant just over 40,000 were kept waiting beyond that period.  The figures show that the median waiting time reached a record 10 weeks in February, up from 8.4 weeks at the time of the last election.  The shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, accused the Tories of breaking their promises on the NHS. “David Cameron promised to keep waiting times low but today’s figures show his plan for the NHS has failed,” he said. “His reorganisation dragged the NHS down to the point where it can no longer meet waiting time targets despite inheriting lists at a record low.”  At the time of the last election, 92.9% of hospital patients were beginning consultant-led treatment within 18 weeks of referral, meaning just over 20,000 were kept waiting beyond that period.    The NHS is also supposed to ensure that 95% of outpatients start treatment within 18 weeks of referral, but in February the figure was 94.7%, the lowest since June 2008. Nearly 45,000 were still waiting after 18 weeks, a lower number than in both October and November last year.  An NHS England spokesman said: “In February the NHS made further strides in cutting long waits, with the number of patients who waited over a year slashed from over 5,000 three years ago to being in the hundreds now, and with the average wait for an operation being just 10 weeks.”",partial
e7d84dfa,"Changes to Personal Independence Payment regulations The government spends around £50 billion a year to support people with disabilities and health conditions.  Part of that support comes through Personal Independence Payment  PIP . This was introduced to replace the outdated Disability Living Allowance and helps with the extra costs that can often come with being disabled, such as added transport costs or assistance with cooking.  The PIP assessment is designed to focus more support on those who are likely to have a higher level of need, and higher costs associated with their disability. For example, claimants who require therapy at home, like dialysis or oxygen, are likely to need more support than someone who needs help to take medication. Similarly, people who cannot carry out a journey because of a visual or cognitive impairment are likely to need more support than someone who experiences psychological distress when they undertake a journey, for example as a result of social phobia or anxiety.  Recent legal judgments have interpreted the assessment criteria for PIP in ways that are different to what was originally intended. The government is now making amendments to clarify the criteria, to restore the original aim of the policy and ensure support goes to those most in need.  This is not a policy change and will not result in any claimants seeing a reduction in the amount of PIP previously awarded by the Department for Work and Pensions  DWP . The purpose is to restore the original intention of the benefit which has been expanded by the legal judgments.  Spending on disability benefits has risen by more than £3 billion in real terms since 2010, and will remain higher in each year to 2020, than in 2010. Failing to reinstate the original intention of the policy would have led to substantial unplanned increases to public expenditure totalling £3.7 billion between 2016 to 2017 and 2021 to 2022.

The government said it estimated the benefits of signing a US-UK trade deal would range from 0.16 per cent of additional GDP in 15 years at the upper end, down to 0.07 per cent of GDP if the deal liberalised trade less than hoped.

c1af4bf0,"When Will The Planet Be Too Hot For Humans? Much, Much Sooner Than You Imagine. To read an annotated version of this article, complete with interviews with scientists and links to further reading, click here.  I. ‘Doomsday’  Peering beyond scientific reticence.  It is, I promise, worse than you think. If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible, even within the lifetime of a teenager today. And yet the swelling seas — and the cities they will drown — have so dominated the picture of global warming, and so overwhelmed our capacity for climate panic, that they have occluded our perception of other threats, many much closer at hand. Rising oceans are bad, in fact very bad; but fleeing the coastline will not be enough.  Indeed, absent a significant adjustment to how billions of humans conduct their lives, parts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century.  Even when we train our eyes on climate change, we are unable to comprehend its scope. This past winter, a string of days 60 and 70 degrees warmer than normal baked the North Pole, melting the permafrost that encased Norway’s Svalbard seed vault — a global food bank nicknamed “Doomsday,” designed to ensure that our agriculture survives any catastrophe, and which appeared to have been flooded by climate change less than ten years after being built.  Related Stories The Uninhabitable Earth, Annotated Edition  The Doomsday vault is fine, for now: The structure has been secured and the seeds are safe. But treating the episode as a parable of impending flooding missed the more important news. Until recently, permafrost was not a major concern of climate scientists, because, as the name suggests, it was soil that stayed permanently frozen. But Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon, more than twice as much as is currently suspended in the Earth’s atmosphere. When it thaws and is released, that carbon may evaporate as methane, which is 34 times as powerful a greenhouse-gas warming blanket as carbon dioxide when judged on the timescale of a century; when judged on the timescale of two decades, it is 86 times as powerful. In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.  Maybe you know that already — there are alarming stories in the news every day, like those, last month, that seemed to suggest satellite data showed the globe warming since 1998 more than twice as fast as scientists had thought (in fact, the underlying story was considerably less alarming than the headlines). Or the news from Antarctica this past May, when a crack in an ice shelf grew 11 miles in six days, then kept going; the break now has just three miles to go — by the time you read this, it may already have met the open water, where it will drop into the sea one of the biggest icebergs ever, a process known poetically as “calving.”  But no matter how well-informed you are, you are surely not alarmed enough. Over the past decades, our culture has gone apocalyptic with zombie movies and Mad Max dystopias, perhaps the collective result of displaced climate anxiety, and yet when it comes to contemplating real-world warming dangers, we suffer from an incredible failure of imagination. The reasons for that are many: the timid language of scientific probabilities, which the climatologist James Hansen once called “scientific reticence” in a paper chastising scientists for editing their own observations so conscientiously that they failed to communicate how dire the threat really was; the fact that the country is dominated by a group of technocrats who believe any problem can be solved and an opposing culture that doesn’t even see warming as a problem worth addressing; the way that climate denialism has made scientists even more cautious in offering speculative warnings; the simple speed of change and, also, its slowness, such that we are only seeing effects now of warming from decades past; our uncertainty about uncertainty, which the climate writer Naomi Oreskes in particular has suggested stops us from preparing as though anything worse than a median outcome were even possible; the way we assume climate change will hit hardest elsewhere, not everywhere; the smallness (two degrees) and largeness (1.8 trillion tons) and abstractness (400 parts per million) of the numbers; the discomfort of considering a problem that is very difficult, if not impossible, to solve; the altogether incomprehensible scale of that problem, which amounts to the prospect of our own annihilation; simple fear. But aversion arising from fear is a form of denial, too.  In between scientific reticence and science fiction is science itself. This article is the result of dozens of interviews and exchanges with climatologists and researchers in related fields and reflects hundreds of scientific papers on the subject of climate change. What follows is not a series of predictions of what will happen — that will be determined in large part by the much-less-certain science of human response. Instead, it is a portrait of our best understanding of where the planet is heading absent aggressive action. It is unlikely that all of these warming scenarios will be fully realized, largely because the devastation along the way will shake our complacency. But those scenarios, and not the present climate, are the baseline. In fact, they are our schedule.  The present tense of climate change — the destruction we’ve already baked into our future — is horrifying enough. Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance of surviving; most of the scientists I spoke with assume we’ll lose them within the century, even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next decade. Two degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of catastrophe: tens of millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an unprepared world. Now two degrees is our goal, per the Paris climate accords, and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues serial reports, often called the “gold standard” of climate research; the most recent one projects us to hit four degrees of warming by the beginning of the next century, should we stay the present course. But that’s just a median projection. The upper end of the probability curve runs as high as eight degrees — and the authors still haven’t figured out how to deal with that permafrost melt. The IPCC reports also don’t fully account for the albedo effect (less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight, hence more warming); more cloud cover (which traps heat); or the dieback of forests and other flora (which extract carbon from the atmosphere). Each of these promises to accelerate warming, and the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years. The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer, Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World, his new history of the planet’s major extinction events, the oceans were hundreds of feet higher.*  The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now, each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock, and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into. Unless you are a teenager, you probably read in your high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of asteroids. In fact, all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas. The most notorious was 252 million years ago; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees, accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic, and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead. We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably faster rate; by most estimates, at least ten times faster. The rate is accelerating. This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind when he said, this spring, that the species needs to colonize other planets in the next century to survive, and what drove Elon Musk, last month, to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years. These are nonspecialists, of course, and probably as inclined to irrational panic as you or I. But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the past several months — the most credentialed and tenured in the field, few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who nevertheless criticize its conservatism — have quietly reached an apocalyptic conclusion, too: No plausible program of emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster.  Over the past few decades, the term “Anthropocene” has climbed out of academic discourse and into the popular imagination — a name given to the geologic era we live in now, and a way to signal that it is a new era, defined on the wall chart of deep history by human intervention. One problem with the term is that it implies a conquest of nature (and even echoes the biblical “dominion”). And however sanguine you might be about the proposition that we have already ravaged the natural world, which we surely have, it is another thing entirely to consider the possibility that we have only provoked it, engineering first in ignorance and then in denial a climate system that will now go to war with us for many centuries, perhaps until it destroys us. That is what Wallace Smith Broecker, the avuncular oceanographer who coined the term “global warming,” means when he calls the planet an “angry beast.” You could also go with “war machine.” Each day we arm it more.  II. Heat Death  The bahraining of New York.  In the sugar­cane region of El Salvador, as much as one-fifth of the population has chronic kidney disease, the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades ago. Photo: Heartless Machine  Humans, like all mammals, are heat engines; surviving means having to continually cool off, like panting dogs. For that, the temperature needs to be low enough for the air to act as a kind of refrigerant, drawing heat off the skin so the engine can keep pumping. At seven degrees of warming, that would become impossible for large portions of the planet’s equatorial band, and especially the tropics, where humidity adds to the problem; in the jungles of Costa Rica, for instance, where humidity routinely tops 90 percent, simply moving around outside when it’s over 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be lethal. And the effect would be fast: Within a few hours, a human body would be cooked to death from both inside and out.  Climate-change skeptics point out that the planet has warmed and cooled many times before, but the climate window that has allowed for human life is very narrow, even by the standards of planetary history. At 11 or 12 degrees of warming, more than half the world’s population, as distributed today, would die of direct heat. Things almost certainly won’t get that hot this century, though models of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually. This century, and especially in the tropics, the pain points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven degrees. The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature, which is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds: the heat registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it’s swung around in the air (since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air, this single number reflects both heat and humidity). At present, most regions reach a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees Celsius; the true red line for habitability is 35 degrees. What is called heat stress comes much sooner.  Related Stories Michael Oppenheimer: Only 10 Percent Chance We Meet Paris Targets  Actually, we’re about there already. Since 1980, the planet has experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing dangerous or extreme heat; a bigger increase is to come. The five warmest summers in Europe since 1500 have all occurred since 2002, and soon, the IPCC warns, simply being outdoors that time of year will be unhealthy for much of the globe. Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming, cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable, annually encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in 2015. At four degrees, the deadly European heat wave of 2003, which killed as many as 2,000 people a day, will be a normal summer. At six, according to an assessment focused only on effects within the U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley, and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone, anywhere, in the world today. As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative primer Climate Change: What Everyone Needs to Know, heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain, one of the planet’s hottest spots, and the temperature in Bahrain “would induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans.” The high-end IPCC estimate, remember, is two degrees warmer still. By the end of the century, the World Bank has estimated, the coolest months in tropical South America, Africa, and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century. Air-conditioning can help but will ultimately only add to the carbon problem; plus, the climate-controlled malls of the Arab emirates aside, it is not remotely plausible to wholesale air-condition all the hottest parts of the world, many of them also the poorest. And indeed, the crisis will be most dramatic across the Middle East and Persian Gulf, where in 2015 the heat index registered temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit. As soon as several decades from now, the hajj will become physically impossible for the 2 million Muslims who make the pilgrimage each year.  It is not just the hajj, and it is not just Mecca; heat is already killing us. In the sugarcane region of El Salvador, as much as one-fifth of the population has chronic kidney disease, including over a quarter of the men, the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades ago. With dialysis, which is expensive, those with kidney failure can expect to live five years; without it, life expectancy is in the weeks. Of course, heat stress promises to pummel us in places other than our kidneys, too. As I type that sentence, in the California desert in mid-June, it is 121 degrees outside my door. It is not a record high.  III. The End of Food  Praying for cornfields in the tundra.  Climates differ and plants vary, but the basic rule for staple cereal crops grown at optimal temperature is that for every degree of warming, yields decline by 10 percent. Some estimates run as high as 15 or even 17 percent. Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them. And proteins are worse: It takes 16 calories of grain to produce just a single calorie of hamburger meat, butchered from a cow that spent its life polluting the climate with methane farts.  Pollyannaish plant physiologists will point out that the cereal-crop math applies only to those regions already at peak growing temperature, and they are right — theoretically, a warmer climate will make it easier to grow corn in Greenland. But as the pathbreaking work by Rosamond Naylor and David Battisti has shown, the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain, and those places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature — which means even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining productivity. And you can’t easily move croplands north a few hundred miles, because yields in places like remote Canada and Russia are limited by the quality of soil there; it takes many centuries for the planet to produce optimally fertile dirt.  Drought might be an even bigger problem than heat, with some of the world’s most arable land turning quickly to desert. Precipitation is notoriously hard to model, yet predictions for later this century are basically unanimous: unprecedented droughts nearly everywhere food is today produced. By 2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl ever was. The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of the Middle East; some of the most densely populated parts of Australia, Africa, and South America; and the breadbasket regions of China. None of these places, which today supply much of the world’s food, will be reliable sources of any. As for the original dust bowl: The droughts in the American plains and Southwest would not just be worse than in the 1930s, a 2015 NASA study predicted, but worse than any droughts in a thousand years — and that includes those that struck between 1100 and 1300, which “dried up all the rivers East of the Sierra Nevada mountains” and may have been responsible for the death of the Anasazi civilization.  Remember, we do not live in a world without hunger as it is. Far from it: Most estimates put the number of undernourished at 800 million globally. In case you haven’t heard, this spring has already brought an unprecedented quadruple famine to Africa and the Middle East; the U.N. has warned that separate starvation events in Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria, and Yemen could kill 20 million this year alone.  IV. Climate Plagues  What happens when the bubonic ice melts?  Rock, in the right spot, is a record of planetary history, eras as long as millions of years flattened by the forces of geological time into strata with amplitudes of just inches, or just an inch, or even less. Ice works that way, too, as a climate ledger, but it is also frozen history, some of which can be reanimated when unfrozen. There are now, trapped in Arctic ice, diseases that have not circulated in the air for millions of years — in some cases, since before humans were around to encounter them. Which means our immune systems would have no idea how to fight back when those prehistoric plagues emerge from the ice.  The Arctic also stores terrifying bugs from more recent times. In Alaska, already, researchers have discovered remnants of the 1918 flu that infected as many as 500 million and killed as many as 100 million — about 5 percent of the world’s population and almost six times as many as had died in the world war for which the pandemic served as a kind of gruesome capstone. As the BBC reported in May, scientists suspect smallpox and the bubonic plague are trapped in Siberian ice, too — an abridged history of devastating human sickness, left out like egg salad in the Arctic sun.  Experts caution that many of these organisms won’t actually survive the thaw and point to the fastidious lab conditions under which they have already reanimated several of them — the 32,000-year-old “extremophile” bacteria revived in 2005, an 8 million-year-old bug brought back to life in 2007, the 3.5 million–year–old one a Russian scientist self-injected just out of curiosity — to suggest that those are necessary conditions for the return of such ancient plagues. But already last year, a boy was killed and 20 others infected by anthrax released when retreating permafrost exposed the frozen carcass of a reindeer killed by the bacteria at least 75 years earlier; 2,000 present-day reindeer were infected, too, carrying and spreading the disease beyond the tundra.  What concerns epidemiologists more than ancient diseases are existing scourges relocated, rewired, or even re-evolved by warming. The first effect is geographical. Before the early-modern period, when adventuring sailboats accelerated the mixing of peoples and their bugs, human provinciality was a guard against pandemic. Today, even with globalization and the enormous intermingling of human populations, our ecosystems are mostly stable, and this functions as another limit, but global warming will scramble those ecosystems and help disease trespass those limits as surely as Cortés did. You don’t worry much about dengue or malaria if you are living in Maine or France. But as the tropics creep northward and mosquitoes migrate with them, you will. You didn’t much worry about Zika a couple of years ago, either.  As it happens, Zika may also be a good model of the second worrying effect — disease mutation. One reason you hadn’t heard about Zika until recently is that it had been trapped in Uganda; another is that it did not, until recently, appear to cause birth defects. Scientists still don’t entirely understand what happened, or what they missed. But there are things we do know for sure about how climate affects some diseases: Malaria, for instance, thrives in hotter regions not just because the mosquitoes that carry it do, too, but because for every degree increase in temperature, the parasite reproduces ten times faster. Which is one reason that the World Bank estimates that by 2050, 5.2 billion people will be reckoning with it.  V. Unbreathable Air  A rolling death smog that suffocates millions.  By the end of the century, the coolest months in tropical South America, Africa, and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the 20th century. Photo: Heartless Machine  Our lungs need oxygen, but that is only a fraction of what we breathe. The fraction of carbon dioxide is growing: It just crossed 400 parts per million, and high-end estimates extrapolating from current trends suggest it will hit 1,000 ppm by 2100. At that concentration, compared to the air we breathe now, human cognitive ability declines by 21 percent.  Other stuff in the hotter air is even scarier, with small increases in pollution capable of shortening life spans by ten years. The warmer the planet gets, the more ozone forms, and by mid-century, Americans will likely suffer a 70 percent increase in unhealthy ozone smog, the National Center for Atmospheric Research has projected. By 2090, as many as 2 billion people globally will be breathing air above the WHO “safe” level; one paper last month showed that, among other effects, a pregnant mother’s exposure to ozone raises the child’s risk of autism (as much as tenfold, combined with other environmental factors). Which does make you think again about the autism epidemic in West Hollywood.  Already, more than 10,000 people die each day from the small particles emitted from fossil-fuel burning; each year, 339,000 people die from wildfire smoke, in part because climate change has extended forest-fire season (in the U.S., it’s increased by 78 days since 1970). By 2050, according to the U.S. Forest Service, wildfires will be twice as destructive as they are today; in some places, the area burned could grow fivefold. What worries people even more is the effect that would have on emissions, especially when the fires ravage forests arising out of peat. Peatland fires in Indonesia in 1997, for instance, added to the global CO2 release by up to 40 percent, and more burning only means more warming only means more burning. There is also the terrifying possibility that rain forests like the Amazon, which in 2010 suffered its second “hundred-year drought” in the space of five years, could dry out enough to become vulnerable to these kinds of devastating, rolling forest fires — which would not only expel enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere but also shrink the size of the forest. That is especially bad because the Amazon alone provides 20 percent of our oxygen.  Then there are the more familiar forms of pollution. In 2013, melting Arctic ice remodeled Asian weather patterns, depriving industrial China of the natural ventilation systems it had come to depend on, which blanketed much of the country’s north in an unbreathable smog. Literally unbreathable. A metric called the Air Quality Index categorizes the risks and tops out at the 301-to-500 range, warning of “serious aggravation of heart or lung disease and premature mortality in persons with cardiopulmonary disease and the elderly” and, for all others, “serious risk of respiratory effects”; at that level, “everyone should avoid all outdoor exertion.” The Chinese “airpocalypse” of 2013 peaked at what would have been an Air Quality Index of over 800. That year, smog was responsible for a third of all deaths in the country.  VI. Perpetual War  The violence baked into heat.  Climatologists are very careful when talking about Syria. They want you to know that while climate change did produce a drought that contributed to civil war, it is not exactly fair to saythat the conflict is the result of warming; next door, for instance, Lebanon suffered the same crop failures. But researchers like Marshall Burke and Solomon Hsiang have managed to quantify some of the non-obvious relationships between temperature and violence: For every half-degree of warming, they say, societies will see between a 10 and 20 percent increase in the likelihood of armed conflict. In climate science, nothing is simple, but the arithmetic is harrowing: A planet five degrees warmer would have at least half again as many wars as we do today. Overall, social conflict could more than double this century.  This is one reason that, as nearly every climate scientist I spoke to pointed out, the U.S. military is obsessed with climate change: The drowning of all American Navy bases by sea-level rise is trouble enough, but being the world’s policeman is quite a bit harder when the crime rate doubles. Of course, it’s not just Syria where climate has contributed to conflict. Some speculate that the elevated level of strife across the Middle East over the past generation reflects the pressures of global warming — a hypothesis all the more cruel considering that warming began accelerating when the industrialized world extracted and then burned the region’s oil.  What accounts for the relationship between climate and conflict? Some of it comes down to agriculture and economics; a lot has to do with forced migration, already at a record high, with at least 65 million displaced people wandering the planet right now. But there is also the simple fact of individual irritability. Heat increases municipal crime rates, and swearing on social media, and the likelihood that a major-league pitcher, coming to the mound after his teammate has been hit by a pitch, will hit an opposing batter in retaliation. And the arrival of air-conditioning in the developed world, in the middle of the past century, did little to solve the problem of the summer crime wave.  VII. Permanent Economic Collapse  Dismal capitalism in a half-poorer world.  The murmuring mantra of global neoliberalism, which prevailed between the end of the Cold War and the onset of the Great Recession, is that economic growth would save us from anything and everything.  But in the aftermath of the 2008 crash, a growing number of historians studying what they call “fossil capitalism” have begun to suggest that the entire history of swift economic growth, which began somewhat suddenly in the 18th century, is not the result of innovation or trade or the dynamics of global capitalism but simply our discovery of fossil fuels and all their raw power — a onetime injection of new “value” into a system that had previously been characterized by global subsistence living. Before fossil fuels, nobody lived better than their parents or grandparents or ancestors from 500 years before, except in the immediate aftermath of a great plague like the Black Death, which allowed the lucky survivors to gobble up the resources liberated by mass graves. After we’ve burned all the fossil fuels, these scholars suggest, perhaps we will return to a “steady state” global economy. Of course, that onetime injection has a devastating long-term cost: climate change.  The most exciting research on the economics of warming has also come from Hsiang and his colleagues, who are not historians of fossil capitalism but who offer some very bleak analysis of their own: Every degree Celsius of warming costs, on average, 1.2 percent of GDP (an enormous number, considering we count growth in the low single digits as “strong”). This is the sterling work in the field, and their median projection is for a 23 percent loss in per capita earning globally by the end of this century (resulting from changes in agriculture, crime, storms, energy, mortality, and labor).  Tracing the shape of the probability curve is even scarier: There is a 12 percent chance that climate change will reduce global output by more than 50 percent by 2100, they say, and a 51 percent chance that it lowers per capita GDP by 20 percent or more by then, unless emissions decline. By comparison, the Great Recession lowered global GDP by about 6 percent, in a onetime shock; Hsiang and his colleagues estimate a one-in-eight chance of an ongoing and irreversible effect by the end of the century that is eight times worse.  The scale of that economic devastation is hard to comprehend, but you can start by imagining what the world would look like today with an economy half as big, which would produce only half as much value, generating only half as much to offer the workers of the world. It makes the grounding of flights out of heat-stricken Phoenix last month seem like pathetically small economic potatoes. And, among other things, it makes the idea of postponing government action on reducing emissions and relying solely on growth and technology to solve the problem an absurd business calculation.  Every round-trip ticket on flights from New York to London, keep in mind, costs the Arctic three more square meters of ice.  VIII. Poisoned Oceans  Sulfide burps off the skeleton coast.  That the sea will become a killer is a given. Barring a radical reduction of emissions, we will see at least four feet of sea-level rise and possibly ten by the end of the century. A third of the world’s major cities are on the coast, not to mention its power plants, ports, navy bases, farmlands, fisheries, river deltas, marshlands, and rice-paddy empires, and even those above ten feet will flood much more easily, and much more regularly, if the water gets that high. At least 600 million people live within ten meters of sea level today.  But the drowning of those homelands is just the start. At present, more than a third of the world’s carbon is sucked up by the oceans — thank God, or else we’d have that much more warming already. But the result is what’s called “ocean acidification,” which, on its own, may add a half a degree to warming this century. It is also already burning through the planet’s water basins — you may remember these as the place where life arose in the first place. You have probably heard of “coral bleaching” — that is, coral dying — which is very bad news, because reefs support as much as a quarter of all marine life and supply food for half a billion people. Ocean acidification will fry fish populations directly, too, though scientists aren’t yet sure how to predict the effects on the stuff we haul out of the ocean to eat; they do know that in acid waters, oysters and mussels will struggle to grow their shells, and that when the pH of human blood drops as much as the oceans’ pH has over the past generation, it induces seizures, comas, and sudden death.  That isn’t all that ocean acidification can do. Carbon absorption can initiate a feedback loop in which underoxygenated waters breed different kinds of microbes that turn the water still more “anoxic,” first in deep ocean “dead zones,” then gradually up toward the surface. There, the small fish die out, unable to breathe, which means oxygen-eating bacteria thrive, and the feedback loop doubles back. This process, in which dead zones grow like cancers, choking off marine life and wiping out fisheries, is already quite advanced in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and just off Namibia, where hydrogen sulfide is bubbling out of the sea along a thousand-mile stretch of land known as the “Skeleton Coast.” The name originally referred to the detritus of the whaling industry, but today it’s more apt than ever. Hydrogen sulfide is so toxic that evolution has trained us to recognize the tiniest, safest traces of it, which is why our noses are so exquisitely skilled at registering flatulence. Hydrogen sulfide is also the thing that finally did us in that time 97 percent of all life on Earth died, once all the feedback loops had been triggered and the circulating jet streams of a warmed ocean ground to a halt — it’s the planet’s preferred gas for a natural holocaust. Gradually, the ocean’s dead zones spread, killing off marine species that had dominated the oceans for hundreds of millions of years, and the gas the inert waters gave off into the atmosphere poisoned everything on land. Plants, too. It was millions of years before the oceans recovered.  IX. The Great Filter  Our present eeriness cannot last.  So why can’t we see it? In his recent book-length essay The Great Derangement, the Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh wonders why global warming and natural disaster haven’t become major subjects of contemporary fiction — why we don’t seem able to imagine climate catastrophe, and why we haven’t yet had a spate of novels in the genre he basically imagines into half-existence and names “the environmental uncanny.” “Consider, for example, the stories that congeal around questions like, ‘Where were you when the Berlin Wall fell?’ or ‘Where were you on 9/11?’ ” he writes. “Will it ever be possible to ask, in the same vein, ‘Where were you at 400 ppm?’ or ‘Where were you when the Larsen B ice shelf broke up?’ ” His answer: Probably not, because the dilemmas and dramas of climate change are simply incompatible with the kinds of stories we tell ourselves about ourselves, especially in novels, which tend to emphasize the journey of an individual conscience rather than the poisonous miasma of social fate.  Surely this blindness will not last — the world we are about to inhabit will not permit it. In a six-degree-warmer world, the Earth’s ecosystem will boil with so many natural disasters that we will just start calling them “weather”: a constant swarm of out-of-control typhoons and tornadoes and floods and droughts, the planet assaulted regularly with climate events that not so long ago destroyed whole civilizations. The strongest hurricanes will come more often, and we’ll have to invent new categories with which to describe them; tornadoes will grow longer and wider and strike much more frequently, and hail rocks will quadruple in size. Humans used to watch the weather to prophesy the future; going forward, we will see in its wrath the vengeance of the past. Early naturalists talked often about “deep time” — the perception they had, contemplating the grandeur of this valley or that rock basin, of the profound slowness of nature. What lies in store for us is more like what the Victorian anthropologists identified as “dreamtime,” or “everywhen”: the semi-mythical experience, described by Aboriginal Australians, of encountering, in the present moment, an out-of-time past, when ancestors, heroes, and demigods crowded an epic stage. You can find it already watching footage of an iceberg collapsing into the sea — a feeling of history happening all at once.  It is. Many people perceive climate change as a sort of moral and economic debt, accumulated since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and now come due after several centuries — a helpful perspective, in a way, since it is the carbon-burning processes that began in 18th-century England that lit the fuse of everything that followed. But more than half of the carbon humanity has exhaled into the atmosphere in its entire history has been emitted in just the past three decades; since the end of World War II, the figure is 85 percent. Which means that, in the length of a single generation, global warming has brought us to the brink of planetary catastrophe, and that the story of the industrial world’s kamikaze mission is also the story of a single lifetime. My father’s, for instance: born in 1938, among his first memories the news of Pearl Harbor and the mythic Air Force of the propaganda films that followed, films that doubled as advertisements for imperial-American industrial might; and among his last memories the coverage of the desperate signing of the Paris climate accords on cable news, ten weeks before he died of lung cancer last July. Or my mother’s: born in 1945, to German Jews fleeing the smokestacks through which their relatives were incinerated, now enjoying her 72nd year in an American commodity paradise, a paradise supported by the supply chains of an industrialized developing world. She has been smoking for 57 of those years, unfiltered.  Or the scientists’. Some of the men who first identified a changing climate (and given the generation, those who became famous were men) are still alive; a few are even still working. Wally Broecker is 84 years old and drives to work at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory across the Hudson every day from the Upper West Side. Like most of those who first raised the alarm, he believes that no amount of emissions reduction alone can meaningfully help avoid disaster. Instead, he puts his faith in carbon capture — untested technology to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which Broecker estimates will cost at least several trillion dollars — and various forms of “geoengineering,” the catchall name for a variety of moon-shot technologies far-fetched enough that many climate scientists prefer to regard them as dreams, or nightmares, from science fiction. He is especially focused on what’s called the aerosol approach — dispersing so much sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere that when it converts to sulfuric acid, it will cloud a fifth of the horizon and reflect back 2 percent of the sun’s rays, buying the planet at least a little wiggle room, heat-wise. “Of course, that would make our sunsets very red, would bleach the sky, would make more acid rain,” he says. “But you have to look at the magnitude of the problem. You got to watch that you don’t say the giant problem shouldn’t be solved because the solution causes some smaller problems.” He won’t be around to see that, he told me. “But in your lifetime …”  Jim Hansen is another member of this godfather generation. Born in 1941, he became a climatologist at the University of Iowa, developed the groundbreaking “Zero Model” for projecting climate change, and later became the head of climate research at NASA, only to leave under pressure when, while still a federal employee, he filed a lawsuit against the federal government charging inaction on warming (along the way he got arrested a few times for protesting, too). The lawsuit, which is brought by a collective called Our Children’s Trust and is often described as “kids versus climate change,” is built on an appeal to the equal-protection clause, namely, that in failing to take action on warming, the government is violating it by imposing massive costs on future generations; it is scheduled to be heard this winter in Oregon district court. Hansen has recently given up on solving the climate problem with a carbon tax alone, which had been his preferred approach, and has set about calculating the total cost of the additional measure of extracting carbon from the atmosphere.  Hansen began his career studying Venus, which was once a very Earth-like planet with plenty of life-supporting water before runaway climate change rapidly transformed it into an arid and uninhabitable sphere enveloped in an unbreathable gas; he switched to studying our planet by 30, wondering why he should be squinting across the solar system to explore rapid environmental change when he could see it all around him on the planet he was standing on. “When we wrote our first paper on this, in 1981,” he told me, “I remember saying to one of my co-authors, ‘This is going to be very interesting. Sometime during our careers, we’re going to see these things beginning to happen.’ ”  Several of the scientists I spoke with proposed global warming as the solution to Fermi’s famous paradox, which asks, If the universe is so big, then why haven’t we encountered any other intelligent life in it? The answer, they suggested, is that the natural life span of a civilization may be only several thousand years, and the life span of an industrial civilization perhaps only several hundred. In a universe that is many billions of years old, with star systems separated as much by time as by space, civilizations might emerge and develop and burn themselves up simply too fast to ever find one another. Peter Ward, a charismatic paleontologist among those responsible for discovering that the planet’s mass extinctions were caused by greenhouse gas, calls this the “Great Filter”: “Civilizations rise, but there’s an environmental filter that causes them to die off again and disappear fairly quickly,” he told me. “If you look at planet Earth, the filtering we’ve had in the past has been in these mass extinctions.” The mass extinction we are now living through has only just begun; so much more dying is coming.  And yet, improbably, Ward is an optimist. So are Broecker and Hansen and many of the other scientists I spoke to. We have not developed much of a religion of meaning around climate change that might comfort us, or give us purpose, in the face of possible annihilation. But climate scientists have a strange kind of faith: We will find a way to forestall radical warming, they say, because we must.  It is not easy to know how much to be reassured by that bleak certainty, and how much to wonder whether it is another form of delusion; for global warming to work as parable, of course, someone needs to survive to tell the story. The scientists know that to even meet the Paris goals, by 2050, carbon emissions from energy and industry, which are still rising, will have to fall by half each decade; emissions from land use (deforestation, cow farts, etc.) will have to zero out; and we will need to have invented technologies to extract, annually, twice as much carbon from the atmosphere as the entire planet’s plants now do. Nevertheless, by and large, the scientists have an enormous confidence in the ingenuity of humans — a confidence perhaps bolstered by their appreciation for climate change, which is, after all, a human invention, too. They point to the Apollo project, the hole in the ozone we patched in the 1980s, the passing of the fear of mutually assured destruction. Now we’ve found a way to engineer our own doomsday, and surely we will find a way to engineer our way out of it, one way or another. The planet is not used to being provoked like this, and climate systems designed to give feedback over centuries or millennia prevent us — even those who may be watching closely — from fully imagining the damage done already to the planet. But when we do truly see the world we’ve made, they say, we will also find a way to make it livable. For them, the alternative is simply unimaginable.  *This article appears in the July 10, 2017, issue of New York Magazine.  *This article has been updated to provide context for the recent news reports about revisions to a satellite data set, to more accurately reflect the rate of warming during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, to clarify a reference to Peter Brannen’s The Ends of the World, and to make clear that James Hansen still supports a carbon-tax based approach to emissions.

It’s one of the mightiest rivers you will never see, carrying some 30 times more water than all the world’s freshwater rivers combined. In the North Atlantic, one arm of the Gulf Stream breaks toward Iceland, transporting vast amounts of warmth far northward, by one estimate supplying Scandinavia with heat equivalent to 78,000 times its current energy use. Without this current — a heat pump on a planetary scale — scientists believe that great swaths of the world might look quite different.  Now, a spate of studies, including one published last week, suggests this northern portion of the Gulf Stream and the deep ocean currents it’s connected to may be slowing. Pushing the bounds of oceanography, scientists have slung necklace-like sensor arrays across the Atlantic to better understand the complex network of currents that the Gulf Stream belongs to, not only at the surface, but hundreds of feet deep.  “We’re all wishing it’s not true,” Peter de Menocal, a paleoceanographer and president and director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said of the changing ocean currents. “Because if that happens, it’s just a monstrous change.”  The consequences could include faster sea level rise along parts of the Eastern United States and parts of Europe, stronger hurricanes barreling into the Southeastern United States, and perhaps most ominously, reduced rainfall across the Sahel, a semi-arid swath of land running the width of Africa that is already a geopolitical tinderbox.  The scientists’ concern stems from their understanding of thousands of years of the prehistoric climate record. In the past, a great weakening or even shutdown of this arm of the Gulf Stream seems to have triggered rapid changes in temperatures and precipitation patterns around the North Atlantic and beyond.  The northern arm of the Gulf Stream is but one tentacle of a larger, ocean-spanning tangle of currents called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC. Scientists have strong evidence from ice and sediment cores that the AMOC has weakened and shut down before in the past 13,000 years. As a result, mean temperatures in parts of Europe may have rapidly dropped to about 15 degrees Celsius below today’s averages, ushering in arctic like conditions. Parts of northern Africa and northern South America became much drier. Rainfall may even have declined as far away as what is now China. And some of these changes may have occurred in a matter of decades, maybe less.  The AMOC is thus a poster child for the idea of climatic “tipping points” — of hard-to-predict thresholds in Earth’s climate system that, once crossed, have rapid, cascading effects far beyond the corner of the globe where they occur. “It’s a switch,” said Dr. de Menocal, and one that can be thrown quickly.  Which brings us to the cold blob. Almost everywhere around the world, average temperatures are rising — except southeast of Greenland where a large patch of the North Atlantic has become colder in recent years.  Deep beneath the surface, scientists are searching for changes in the currents. Deep beneath the surface, scientists are searching for changes in the currents.

In short, the cold blob may signal that the northern arm of the Gulf Stream no longer arrives with the same strength to the North Atlantic. That a warming atmosphere has, paradoxically, cooled one part of the world.  The science remains relatively new, and not everyone agrees the AMOC is actually slowing. But in both scientific modeling of climate change and in the prehistoric record, a North Atlantic cooling presages a shutdown of the current. “One of the hallmarks of a shutdown is this cold blob,” says Dr. de Menocal. “The cold blob is a big deal.”  In 1513, the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León noticed something bizarre off the coast of today’s Florida: Relentless currents pushing his ships backward, overpowering the winds blowing them forward. He became the first European to describe the Gulf Stream. Benjamin Franklin finally mapped it in the late 1700s — he named it the “Gulf Stream” — by measuring changes in water temperature on a return trip from England.  Over the 20th century, oceanographers came to realize that the northern branch of the Gulf Stream was part of a gigantic loop of water, with warm surface water flowing north and colder water returning south, deep below the surface. This was the network of currents that scientists now call the AMOC.  The system was driven by North Atlantic water that, as it lost heat to the atmosphere and grew dense, sank to the ocean’s depths, pulling warmer surface water northward. In the middle part of the century, oceanographer Henry Stommel elucidated the physics of how the AMOC could change. His insight was that, depending on the balance of heat and salinity, the sinking effect—called “overturning”—could strengthen, or weaken, or maybe stop completely.  In the 1980s, Wallace Broecker, a geochemist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, pounced on that idea.  Colleagues studying ice cores from the Greenland ice sheet were seeing evidence of strange climatic “flickers” in the past. As Earth warmed from the deep freeze of the last ice age, which peaked around 22,000 years ago, temperatures would rise, then abruptly fall, then rise again just as swiftly. Dr. Broecker theorized this was caused by stops and starts in what he called the ocean’s “great conveyor belt” — the AMOC.  The clearest example began about 12,800 years ago. Glaciers that had once covered much of North America and Europe had retreated considerably, and the world was almost out of the deep freeze. But then, in just a few decades, Greenland and Western Europe plunged back into cold. Temperatures fell by around 10 degrees Celsius, or 18 degrees Fahrenheit, in parts of Greenland. Arctic-like conditions returned to parts of Europe.  The cold snap lasted perhaps 1,300 years — before reversing even more abruptly than it began. Scientists have observed the sudden changes in the pollen deposited at the bottom of European lakes and in changes in ocean sediments near Bermuda.  This forced a paradigm shift in how scientists thought about climate change. Earlier, they had tended to imagine creeping shifts occurring over many millennia. But by the late 1990s, they accepted that abrupt transitions, tipping points, could occur.  This didn’t bode well for humanity’s warming of the atmosphere. Dr. Broecker, who died in 2019, famously warned: “The climate system is an angry beast and we are poking it with sticks.”  Why did the AMOC shut down? A leading theory is that meltwater from retreating glaciers emptied into the North Atlantic or Arctic oceans. Freshwater is lighter than saltwater, and the sudden influx of more buoyant water could have impeded the sinking of denser, saltier water — that critical “overturning” phase of the AMOC.  Today we don’t have massive glacial lakes threatening to disgorge into the North Atlantic. But we do have the Greenland ice sheet, which is melting at the upper end of projections, or about six times faster than in the 1990s. And according to one study, the subpolar North Atlantic recently became less salty than at any time in the past 120 years.  There’s little agreement on cause. Changes in wind patterns or currents may be contributing, as could greater rainfall. But Stefan Rahmstorf, a physical oceanographer with the University of Potsdam in Germany, suspects that, similar to what happened some 12,800 years ago, meltwater from Greenland is beginning to slow the AMOC.  In 2014, a remarkable project launched in the North Atlantic. An array of sophisticated sensors were moored to the ocean floor between Newfoundland, Greenland and Scotland. They’re starting to provide an unprecedented view of the currents that shape the Atlantic.  Here off Labrador, we can see how waters move deep beneath the surface.

In 2015, Dr. Rahmstorf and his colleagues published a seminal paper arguing that the AMOC had weakened by 15 percent in recent decades, a slowdown they said was unprecedented in the past 1,000 years. He and his colleagues recently published another paper that used additional reconstructions of sea temperature around the North Atlantic, some going back 1,600 years, to determine that the recent slowdown began with the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, then accelerated after 1950.  Other scientists have also presented different evidence of a slowdown. The South Atlantic has become saltier in recent decades, according to a study by Chenyu Zhu at Ocean University of China and Zhengyu Liu at Nanjing Normal University, suggesting that more of the salt that once traveled north with the AMOC now remains in the tropics, producing what they call a “salinity pile-up.”  And Christopher Piecuch of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution recently argued that the Gulf Stream along Florida’s coast, also called the Florida current, has weakened. He found this by measuring the differences in sea level across the Gulf Stream. Earth’s rotation deflects flowing water to the right; this causes the two sides of the current to have slightly different sea levels — and the faster the current, the greater the difference. Tide gauge measurements going back 110 years indicate that this contrast has declined, Dr. Piecuch found, particularly in the past two decades. This suggests the current has slowed.  For Dr. Rahmstorf, these lines of evidence bolster the argument that the AMOC is slowing. In his view, the change is occurring right on schedule. “The long-term trend is exactly what was predicted by the models,” he said.  A 2019 report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a synthesis of the most significant climate research worldwide, says that while the AMOC will “very likely” weaken later this century, collapse is “very unlikely.” Yet Dr. Rahmstorf worries about the unknowns in a system that scientists understand can rapidly shift between different states.  He points out that, in IPCC jargon, “very unlikely” translates to a probability of less than 10 percent. But if a nuclear reactor in your neighborhood had a less-than-10-percent likelihood of blowing up, he asked, “would you be reassured?”  “We still don’t know how far away this threshold is where it could break down altogether,” he said. If we limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times — a goal of the Paris agreement among nations to fight climate change — a shutdown is unlikely, he thinks. “But for unmitigated warming,” which is the world’s current trajectory, “I think there’s increasing risk where we make AMOC so weak it goes over the edge and collapses.”  “There will be a lot of surprises if we disturb climate that much,” he said. “It’s not at all predictable how bad things will be.”  Scientists also emphasize that the ultimate consequences of that weakening remain unclear. That’s in part because the world is in such uncharted territory. In the past, Europe became drastically cooler when the current shut down, but today any cooling might ultimately be muted or possibly canceled out by continued global heating.  But if past is prologue, a drastically altered AMOC could certainly shift rainfall patterns, scientists said, making parts of Europe and Northern Africa drier, and areas in the Southern hemisphere wetter. Changing ocean currents might affect marine ecosystems that people rely on for food and livelihood.  A changing Gulf Stream could also accelerate sea-level rise along parts of the Atlantic coast of the United States. In 2009 and 2010, when the stream inexplicably weakened by 30 percent, the Northeast saw seas rise at a rate unprecedented in the entire roughly 100-year record of tide gauges.  And if water in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic becomes warmer because that heat is no longer shunted north, the expanding reservoir of energy could strengthen hurricanes, something that scientists at the National Oceanography Centre in the United Kingdom argue is already happening. Hurricanes derive their energy from heat in the water.  Finally, in a perverse twist, a shutdown of the AMOC could exacerbate global heating. The ocean absorbs nearly one-third of human carbon dioxide emissions. But the sinking of salty, dense water — the overturning portion of the AMOC — is critical to that absorption. So, if the AMOC stops or greatly slows, and that water stops sinking, the accumulation of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere could accelerate.  Then there are those consequences that fall in the category of “global weirding.”  Scientists at the U.K.’s National Oceanography Centre have somewhat counterintuitively linked the cold blob in the North Atlantic with summer heat waves in Europe. In 2015 and 2018, the jet stream, a river of wind that moves from west to east over temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere, made an unusual detour to the south around the cold blob. The wrinkle in atmospheric flow brought hotter-than-usual air into Europe, they contend, breaking temperature records.  The New York Times.  “That was not predicted,” said Joel Hirschi, principal scientist at the centre and senior author of the research. It highlights how current seasonal forecasting models are unable to predict these warm summers. And it underscores the paradox that, far from ushering in a frigid future for, say, Paris, a cooler North Atlantic might actually make France’s summers more like Morocco’s.  Even so, Dr. Hirschi takes a wait-and-see stance on whether the AMOC is actually slowing. “I have great respect for what Dr. Rahmstorf is doing. And it may well be spot on in the end,” he says. “But I’m afraid the data, the really robust data, is not there.”  Susan Lozier, a physical oceanographer and dean at the College of Sciences at Georgia Tech, also has her doubts about whether the AMOC is currently slowing. At issue, she says, is how scientists infer changes in the AMOC. We can directly measure many aspects of the ocean, such as temperature (it’s warming), oxygen levels (they’re declining), even how stratified it has become (more so). “There are very strong signals in the ocean of climate change,” she said.  But most studies on the AMOC don’t measure the “conveyor belt” directly. Instead, they use proxies to infer that the overturning has changed.  Such inference can be problematic when considering changes that occur over short time frames, says Dr. Lozier, because the changes observed could have other causes. Consider that cold blob in the North Atlantic, she said. Dr. Rahmstorf and others see it as evidence of a weakening Gulf Stream, but Dr. Lozier notes that shifts in wind patterns or how storms move over the ocean could also underlie the phenomenon. “There are other ways to explain it,” she said. “A lot of our conceptual understanding of AMOC is in isolation of other things going on in the ocean.”  Direct measurement of the AMOC only began relatively recently. A line of sensors between the Bahamas and the Canary Islands, called Rapid, was installed in 2004. A second sensor array, spanning the North Atlantic from Canada to Greenland to Scotland and called Osnap, went live in 2014. (Dr. Lozier is the international project lead for Osnap.)  Neither project has operated long enough to produce clear trends, in Dr. Lozier’s view. What they have shown, though, is lots of natural variability. In 2009 and 2010, for example, the AMOC weakened — “people were like, ‘Oh my God, this is happening,’” she said — only to pick right back up again over the following years.  They’ve also revealed a system of currents that’s far more complex than once envisioned.  Dr. Broecker’s old schematics of the AMOC posit a neat warm current flowing north along the western edge of the Atlantic and an equally neat cold current flowing back south below it. In fact, says Dr. Lozier, that deeper current is not confined to the western edge of the Atlantic, but rather flows southward via a number of “rivers” that are filled with eddies. The network of deep ocean currents is much more complicated than once envisioned, in other words, and figuring out how buoyant meltwater from Greenland might affect the formation of cold deepwater has become more complicated as well.  This is the place scientists currently find themselves in. They suspect the AMOC can work like a climate switch. They’re watching it closely. Some argue that it’s already changing, others that it’s too soon to tell.  “There’s no consensus on whether it has slowed to date, or if it’s currently slowing,” said Dr. Lozier. “But there is a consensus that if we continue to warm the atmosphere, it will slow.”",partial
a910fe22,"El Niño, explained: A guide to the biggest weather story of 2015 Over the past year, scientists have been keeping a close eye on an important swath of the Pacific Ocean, just along the equator. When conditions here get just right, an El Niño can form — wreaking havoc on weather patterns across the globe.  The El Niño currently brewing in the Pacific is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever recorded. This phenomenon is expected to peak before January, with far-reaching impacts all winter and spring. Based on past experience, El Niño could potentially bring much-needed rain to California, but also drought in Australia, destructive floods in Peru, and so on. El Niño has already helped make 2015 the hottest year on record — and might well do the same for 2016.  That said, El Niño events are often unpredictable and full of surprises. So what follows is a guide to how El Niño works, what we know about the 2015 event, and how a potentially massive El Niño could upend the world's weather over the coming months.  A very basic definition of El Niño  El Niño is a weather phenomenon that occurs irregularly in the eastern tropical Pacific every two to seven years. When the trade winds that usually blow from east to west weaken, sea surface temperatures start rising, setting off a chain of atmospheric impacts.  El Niños can be strong or weak. Strong events can temporarily disrupt weather patterns around the world, typically making certain regions wetter (Peru or California, say) and others drier (Southeast Asia). Some countries suffer major damage as a result.  El Niños also transfer heat stored in the deeper layers of the ocean to the surface. When combined with global warming, that can lead to record hot years, as in 1998.  El Niño got its name in the 1800s from Peruvian fisherman, who first noticed a mysterious warm current that would appear around Christmas. They called it the little boy or Christ child.  Why this year's El Niño is a huge deal  The last truly massive El Niño appeared in 1997-'98 and ended up causing an estimated $35 billion in destruction and 23,000 deaths around the world. (It also inspired that famous Chris Farley sketch.) Now we're facing a similarly massive event:  That, in itself, is a surprise. Back in March, NOAA's Climate Prediction Center announced that a weak El Niño had formed in the Pacific, but many experts initially thought it might fizzle out by summer. Instead, this El Niño kept strengthening, with ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific continuing to soar. By mid-November, temperatures in one critical part of the ocean, the Niño 3.4 region, were running even hotter than they were in 1997:  Right now we say we think it's really going to be one of the three strongest ones, said Michel Jarraud, the secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, who compared it with the 1997-98, 1982-83, and 1972-73 El Niño events. It may be one of the two; that we don't know yet. But definitely it's already a very strong one.  Countries across the globe will have to brace themselves as this event peaks this winter and lasts through the spring. El Niño has already triggered longer droughts in Indonesia, enabling massive man-made peatland fires to rage out of control, creating toxic haze that has spread as far as Singapore. Warmer ocean temperatures have also caused a major coral bleaching event, harming reefs around the world.  And El Niño may just be getting started: In the past, major events have brought unusually hot, dry weather to Australia that can cramp wheat yields and amp up wildfires. It can bring hotter, drier weather to India that hurts agriculture. It can bring heavy rain and destructive flooding to Peru, washing away houses and spreading cholera.  That said, El Niño isn't all bad. In the United States, it could bring some needed rain this winter to ease California's drought (though also deadly mudslides and flooding). Historically, El Niño has also served up milder US winters and tamped down on Atlantic hurricanes.  One important caveat, however, is that every El Niño unfolds a bit differently — and some have unexpected impacts. As NOAA's Emily Becker points out, strong El Niño events usually bring rain to California in the winter (as in 1982-'83), but occasionally they don't (as in 1965-'66):  Another key story to watch is how a strong El Niño might push up temperatures worldwide. Global average temperatures are already going up over time, thanks to all the carbon dioxide we're adding to the atmosphere. According to NASA, 2014 was the hottest year on record. But there was no El Niño that year — and El Niño years tend to be a bit hotter than average, as heat gets transferred from the ocean to the surface.  The combination of El Niño and rising CO2 is already helping 2015 shatter heat records. The big question now is whether it'll do the same for 2016:  Bottom line: There are still a lot of question marks about how this will unfold. But El Niño could well be the biggest weather story of the next several months, with ripple effects around the globe.  How El Niño actually works, step by step  To see how El Niño works, it helps to understand what the equatorial Pacific looks like under normal, or neutral, conditions:  1) Neutral conditions in the equatorial Pacific Ocean  Normally, the tropical Pacific features strong trade winds that blow warm ocean water from east to west, where it piles up near Indonesia. Meanwhile, back east along South America, frigid water deep down in the ocean gets pulled up closer to the surface, cooling the area around Peru. Here's a diagram:  As a result, during neutral conditions, sea levels are about half a meter higher near Indonesia than they are in Peru. And the surface water near Indonesia is about 8°C warmer (14.4°F) than it is near Peru. That temperature difference creates a convective loop in the atmosphere that, in turn, reinforces the trade winds.  This ends up affecting a lot more than just this stretch of ocean. Because the Pacific is so vast, this system is a major driving force in the global climate. The large, warm pool of water near Indonesia causes the air above it to rise, creating rainfall in the region. And this system shapes the jet streams that guide weather and storms around the world.  That's how it works under normal conditions, anyway. But things look a little different when El Niño comes along.  2) Now along comes El Niño  Every few years, those prevailing Pacific trade winds that blow east to west can weaken. (Scientists are still debating the nuances of exactly why this happens.)  When the trade winds weaken, all that warm water that was piled up near Indonesia starts sloshing back eastward, pulled back down by gravity. What's more, the underwater layer known as the thermocline starts sinking. As a result, there's less cold water rising up from the deep ocean near South America — so the waters near Peru start warming up. Here's another diagram:  This causes sea surface temperatures in the east and central Pacific to start rising and the trade winds to weaken even further. What's more, rainfall starts following that warm pool of water as it travels eastward. That's why El Niño is usually associated with drier weather in places like Indonesia and Australia, as well as heavier rains in places like Peru (or California). The rain is essentially moving east.  Scientists officially declare an El Niño when sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean (known as the Niño 3.4 region) rise 0.5°C above their historical baseline for three months in a row — and once atmospheric conditions and rainfall patterns shift accordingly.  Again, because the Pacific is so vast, an El Niño can have large ripple effects on weather around the world, especially during the winter months. Here's a look at the changes that have historically accompanied El Niño events:  Typical effects of an El Niño during the winter:  A strong El Niño can weaken monsoons in the Indian Ocean, for example. It can also cause the jet stream to start stretching from the Eastern Pacific across the southern United States, bringing rainfall and storms with it. Still, a lot depends on how strong the El Niño actually is — and occasionally there are aberrations and exceptions to the rule. More on that below.  El Niño's return in 2015 — and why scientists have been talking about a Godzilla event  Ever since early 2014, scientists have been expecting this latest El Niño to form. But, in a sign of how slippery the system can be, El Niño kept defying predictions and not showing up.  Finally, in March 2015, after several false starts, scientists at NOAA's climate prediction center were ready to declare that a weak El Niño was underway. Specifically, sea surface temperatures in that Niño 3.4 region (roughly in the center of the chart below) had been at least 0.5°C above their baseline since September. And, importantly, atmospheric conditions were responding in turn, with more rain over the central Pacific and less rain over Indonesia:  At the time, however, NOAA's forecasters said that this El Niño looked weak, with possibly minimal effects on global weather patterns, and only had a 50 to 60 percent chance of lasting through the summer.  Then, somewhat unexpectedly, El Niño kept getting stronger and stronger. And stronger. By October 2015, sea surface temperatures had soared to more than 2°C above baseline in the Niño 3.4 region, and scientists were seeing strong telltale atmospheric changes. Notice how the anomalous warm area has moved east and is much, much warmer than usual:  Forecasters now expect this El Niño to peak between October and January, and when it does, it's likely to rank among the two or three strongest ever record (along with 1997-'98, 1982-'83, and 1972-'73.) Some forecasters have even dubbed this one a potential Godzilla.  We're already started to see some major El Niño impacts around the world. A paucity of rainfall in Indonesia this fall allowed manmade forest and peat fires to rage out of control, choking the region in a thick toxic haze. And the warmer Pacific waters have fostered an unusually active tropical cyclone season, a hallmark of El Niño. On the flip side, however, the event has also fostered more wind shear in the Atlantic that has curtailed hurricane activity there.  El Niño could bring rain to California — but may not end the drought  As noted above, El Niño tends to be associated with changes in weather patterns around the world, especially during the Northern Hemisphere winter. One tantalizing possibility is that a strong El Niño will bring more rain to California, alleviating the state's drought.  But even here, nothing is certain. El Niño only affects US weather indirectly, by altering atmospheric circulation and shifting the North Pacific jet stream. (See here for a lucid explanation by Columbia University's Anthony Barnston.) This is an intricate chain of events, and small kinks at certain points can affect the ultimate outcome.  As such, Becker cautions people to think not in terms of certainties but in terms of probabilities. Here's an example of how El Niño might shift the odds of a wetter-than-average winter for California (she notes that this isn't a prediction, just an illustration):  In other words, thanks to El Niño, California has a greater chance of a wetter winter, but not a 100 percent chance.  What's more, even if rain does come, that may not be enough to completely erase the massive water deficit that California has built up over the past five years. The state likely needs record precipitation to end the drought, and it also needs the right mix of rain (to recharge the reservoirs) and snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains (to melt during the spring and summer).  Also, be warned: Heavy rain after a drought can bring floods and mudslides. Southern California got a possible preview in mid-October, when a short burst of intense rains led to major mudflows that trapped hundreds of cars. So people need to be ready.  El Niño tends to hurt some countries and benefit others  It's not quite right to say that El Niño events are bad or good. They tend to have different impacts on different regions.  One recent study from the University of Cambridge found that on average, El Niño events hurt economic activity in Australia, Chile, Indonesia, India, Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa. The reasons varied: drought and reduced crop yields in Australia and India, forest fires in Indonesia, less productive fisheries in Peru.  But that study also found that on average, El Niño tended to boost the economies in Argentina, Canada, Mexico, and even the United States, at least in the very short term. Again, many factors were at play: In addition to bringing needed rain to California and Texas, El Niño was associated with less tornado activity in the midwestern United States and fewer hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean.  Here's a table of the estimated economic impacts on a broad selection of countries:  Again, every big El Niño is different and has its own idiosyncrasies. So think of this table as more a rough guide than gospel.  There are also two important twists here. As the WMO's Michel Jarraud stressed in his October news conference, many countries have learned from the past and implemented measures to guard against El Niño's impacts. (Mexico, for instance, was well-prepared for a record-strength Pacific hurricane that hit the state last month.)  Conversely, this El Niño is also playing out in the context of record warm ocean temperatures, so it could have unpredictable impacts. Our scientific understanding of El Niño has increased greatly in recent years. However, this event is playing out in uncharted territory, said Jarraud. This naturally occurring El Niño event and human induced climate change may interact and modify each other in ways which we have never before experienced.  El Niño is helping make 2015 a record hot year. What about 2016?  Thanks to global warming, the Earth's average surface temperature has been going up over time. But there's a lot of variation from year to year. El Niño years tend to be a bit hotter than average. La Niña years (when those trade winds strengthen rather than weaken) tend to be a bit cooler than average. Like so:  What's going on here? As humans load more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, we're trapping more and more heat on the Earth's surface. But more than 90 percent of that extra heat is absorbed by the oceans. So subtle interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere can make a big difference for surface temperatures.  When conditions in the Pacific are neutral, more of that heat is trapped beneath the ocean surface. When a strong El Niño forms, more of that heat is transferred to the surface. That's why the Earth's average surface temperatures reached new highs in 1998: You had the combination of global warming and an extremely strong El Niño.  What was remarkable about 2014 is that it was likely the hottest year on record even without an El Niño event — a sign that Earth keeps getting warmer overall. Meanwhile, 2015 is basically guaranteed to be even hotter than 2014.  Now throw a monster El Niño into the mix, and we're looking at a potential shattering of records. Back in January, NASA's Gavin Schmidt explained at a press conference that temperatures typically peak about three months after an El Niño event. Given that forecasters expect this current El Niño to last until next spring, it's entirely possible we could see 2016 also set new highs. We'll have to wait and see.  Further reading:",truth
93db83ce,"The three-degree world: cities that will be drowned by global warming When UN climate negotiators meet for summit talks this month, there will be a new figure on the table: 3C.  Until now, global efforts such as the Paris climate agreement have tried to limit global warming to 2C above pre-industrial levels. However, with latest projections pointing to an increase of 3.2C by 2100, these goals seem to be slipping out of reach.  Global temperature change compared to pre-industrial levels  “[We] still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future,” said Erik Solheim, the UN environment chief, ahead of the upcoming Bonn conference.  One of the biggest resulting threats to cities around the world is sea-level rise, caused by the expansion of water at higher temperatures and melting ice sheets on the north and south poles.    Scientists at the non-profit organisation Climate Central estimate that 275 million people worldwide live in areas that will eventually be flooded at 3C of global warming.  Asian cities will be worst affected  The regional impact of these changes is highly uneven, with four out of five people affected living in Asia.  Although sea levels will not rise instantaneously, the calculated increases will be “locked in” at a temperature rise of 3C, meaning they will be irreversible even if warming eventually slows down.  Osaka, Japan  5.2 million people affected  At the end of a month in which it has been battered by unseasonably late typhoons and relentless rain, Japan is already confronting the threat posed by climate change-induced flooding.  Image modelling shows that swaths of Osaka – the commercial heart of a region whose GDP is almost as big as that of the Netherlands – would disappear beneath the water in a 3C world, threatening the local economy and almost a third of the wider region’s 19 million residents.  Millions of people live in the urban area surrounding Osaka. Sea-level rise will reshape densely and sparsely populated areas.  As a result of global sea-level rise, storm surges and other factors, economists project that coastal flooding could put almost $1tn of Osaka’s assets at risk by the 2070s, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.  “The costs of protecting cities from rising sea levels and storms are also likely to rise - as are the costs of repairing storm damage,” it said. “Decisions we make today could have a profound impact on the security and culture of the people of this ancient city.”  Like much of Japan, Osaka already has a network of seawalls and other coastal defences in place to combat tsunami – although their effectiveness was disputed in the aftermath of the 2011 triple disaster.  Osaka city authorities are investing in other infrastructure to mitigate the effects of flooding, but public education is also vital, according to Toshikazu Nakaaki of the Osaka municipal government’s environment bureau.  “In the past our response was focused on reducing the causes of global warming, but given that climate change is inevitable, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we are now discussing how to respond to the natural disasters that will follow,” Nakaaki said.  “We anticipate that Osaka will be affected by natural disasters caused by climate change, but we have yet to establish exactly what might happen or how much financial damage they would cause.  “It’s not that we expect sea levels to rise at some point in the future – they are already rising.”  Keiko Kanai has long been aware that her home city is susceptible to natural disasters. “I’d heard that historically, tsunamis caused by earthquakes put many parts of Osaka underwater, and I knew that some parts of the world were at risk from rising sea levels,” said Kanai, who teaches at a local university.  “But I didn’t put two and two together. Until now I haven’t given much thought to the idea that Osaka too could be engulfed by rising sea levels.”  Kaori Akazawa, a nursing care consultant, said flooding was a consideration when she was deciding where in Osaka to live.  “When I moved here I talked to my colleagues about the risks,” she said. “That’s why I’ve always rented apartments on the fourth storey or higher.    “It’s worrying, but I’ve never considered moving.”  Justin McCurry in Tokyo  Alexandria, Egypt  3 million people affected  On the Alexandria Corniche, waves slowly lap at a shoreline dotted with plastic chairs and umbrellas from the beachside cafes. Students perch on the steps of the imposing Alexandria library. But the same coastline that draws locals to its scenic vistas is threatening to slowly engulf the historic city as sea levels rise due to global warming.  The IPCC reported that Alexandria’s beaches would be submerged even with a 0.5-metre sea-level rise, while 8 million people would be displaced by flooding in Alexandria and the Nile Delta if no protective measures are taken. A 3C world threatens far greater damage than that.  Yet for many residents, there is little public information to connect the increasingly chaotic weather and floods with climate change. “The vast majority of Alexandrians don’t have access to knowledge, and that’s what worries me. I don’t expect the government to raise awareness of this problem until it’s already happening,” said 22-year-old student Kareem Mohammed.  “Everyone thinks we should act on this problem 50 or 80 years from now,” agreed his friend, Hazem Hassan, a student in marine biology at the nearby Alexandria University.  Officials maintain that protective measures are being taken, but with little fanfare. “Egypt spends 700m EGP [£30m] annually to protect the north coast,” said Dr Magdy Allam, head of the Arab Environmental Experts Union, who was previously part of the Egyptian environment ministry.  Allam cited the Mohammed Ali sea wall built in 1830 as a key protection, as well as the concrete blocks lining the shoreline designed to “detour flood water away from residential neighbourhoods”. But critics say that this is far from enough given the scale of the problem.  “There are studies indicating that our city is one of many coastal human settlements around the world which will be partially submerged by 2070 if nothing is done,” said Ahmed Hassan, of the Save Alexandria Initiative, a group that works to raise awareness of the effects of climate change on the city.  Ruth Michaelson in Alexandria  Rio de Janeiro, Brazil  1.8 million people affected  Residents of Brazil’s postcard city have plenty of reasons to fear global warming – even if they don’t quite know it. According to Climate Central, a temperature rise of 3C would cause flooding of not just Rio’s famous beaches such as Copacabana and its waterfront domestic airport, but also inland areas of the Barra de Tijuca neighbourhood, where last year’s Olympic Games were held.  Barra is built around a network of heavily polluted lagoons that empty into the sea. The prospect of it being underwater alarmed resident Sueli Gonçalves, 46, who runs pensioners’ health projects, as she and her 23-year-old son Yuri Sanchez carried their shopping past the Olympic Park.  “My God. Oh Jesus,” she said, with a nervous laugh. “I will leave here. I will go to the United States. To Canada.”  The family knew about global warming but were unaware of the potential scale of the impact on their upscale neighbourhood of smart condominiums and a shopping mall.  “Nobody takes it seriously. People do not think long term,” Gonçalves said.    Storm surges recently destroyed hundreds of metres of beachfront pavement overlooking the Macumba beach, a popular surfing spot on Rio’s western fringes. Last year, heavy waves in another storm surge felled an elevated, clifftop cycle path between Leblon beach and Barra de Tijuca which had not been built to survive such high seas, killing two people.  Last year, Rio’s city government and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro produced a study entitled Strategy for Adapting to Climate Change.  “The current challenge consists in deepening knowledge and monitoring of oceanic phenomena and the evolution of the sea bed and coast,” a spokeswoman for the city’s secretariat of the environment said in an email. An “adaption plan” for climate change produced with professors from the federal university suggested strategies to deal with vulnerabilities in areas such as transport, health and housing. But so far little has been done.    Nara Pinto, 38, who lives in the sprawling Rocinha favela and sells snacks on the pavement overlooking Copacabana beach, said the loss of Rio’s famous beaches would cost a lot of jobs.    “The beach is a tourist point,” she said. “What can be done to stop this?  Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro  Shanghai, China  17.5 million people affected  “Shanghai is completely gone – I’d have to move to Tibet!” says resident Wang Liubin, when he is shown projections for the city after 3C of global warming.  When it comes to flooding, the coastal city is one of the world’s most vulnerable. Now one of the world’s biggest ports, the former fishing village is bordered by the Yangtze river in the north and divided through the middle by the Huangpu river; the municipality involves several islands, two long coastlines, shipping ports, and miles of canals, rivers, and waterways.  In 2012, a report from a team of UK and Dutch scientists declared Shanghai the most vulnerable major city in the world to serious flooding, based on factors such as numbers of people living close to the coastline, time needed to recover from flooding, and measures to prevent floodwater. According to Climate Central projections, 17.5 million people could be displaced by rising waters if global temperatures increase by 3C.  Projections show the vast majority of the city could eventually be submerged in water, including much of the downtown area, landmarks such as the Lujiazui skyline and the historical Bund, both airports, and the entirety of its outlying Chongming Island.  Since 2012, the government has been making steady inroads to tackle the threat, including building China’s largest deepwater drainage system beneath the Suzhou Creek waterway, made up of 15km of pipes to drain rainwater across a 58 sq km area. It has also rolled out a 40bn yuan (£5bn) River Flood Discharge project which will stretch for 120km between Lake Taihu and the Huangpu river to try and mitigate the risk of the upstream lake flooding.  Flood prevention walls are being built along the waterfront – in places so high the river is blocked from view – and 200km more are promised across the city’s outlying districts. Flood controls have been put in place along the famous Bund waterfront, where the walkway has been raised to help counter a flood risk, as well as a series of water controls and dams.  Helen Roxburgh in Shanghai  Miami, US  2.7 million people affected  Few other cities in the world have as much to lose from rising sea levels as Miami, and the alarm bells sound ever louder with each successive “king tide” that overwhelms coastal defences and sends knee-deep seawater coursing through downtown streets.  Locals consider this the “new normal” in the biggest city of Florida’s largest metropolitan area, which would simply cease to exist with a 3C temperature rise. Even at 2C, forecasts show almost the entire bottom third of Florida – the area south of Lake Okeechobee currently home to more than 7 million people - submerged, with grim projections for the rest of the state in a little more than half a century. In Miami-Dade county alone, almost $15bn of coastal property is at risk of flooding in just the next 15 years.    A sense of urgency is evident at city hall, where commissioners are asking voters to approve a “Miami Forever” bond in the November ballot that includes $192m for upgrading pump stations, improving drainage and raising sea walls.  “We have a really precious city that many people love and are willing to invest in right now, but it’s going to take some funds to protect it,” said Ken Russell, the city commission’s vice-chair.  Last year, the city of Miami appointed sea-rise expert Jane Gilbert into the newly created role of chief resilience officer with instructions for a robust stormwater management plan that also looks at storm surge, such as that from Hurricane Irma in September which brought significant flooding to downtown Brickell and neighbouring Coconut Grove.  Proposals include elevating roads and even abandoning neighbourhoods to the water to protect others.  “We need universal recognition that we’re all in this together, to protect this amazing global city that we’ve become,” she said.  Natalia Ortiz, who grew up in Miami, fears the future. “It’s very scary,” said Ortiz, who works with Cleo, a climate change advocacy group. “My son is 11 and my daughter is nine, so they’re young but I think about their future, will they be able to raise their children in Miami the way I had the luxury of raising mine?”  Richard Luscombe in Miami  Methodology  Flood maps were created using sea-level rise estimates from Climate Central and digital elevation data.

9874bc11,"Ice Apocalypse In a remote region of Antarctica known as Pine Island Bay, 2,500 miles from the tip of South America, two glaciers hold human civilization hostage.  Stretching across a frozen plain more than 150 miles long, these glaciers, named Pine Island and Thwaites, have marched steadily for millennia toward the Amundsen Sea, part of the vast Southern Ocean. Further inland, the glaciers widen into a two-mile-thick reserve of ice covering an area the size of Texas.  There’s no doubt this ice will melt as the world warms. The vital question is when.  The glaciers of Pine Island Bay are two of the largest and fastest-melting in Antarctica. (A Rolling Stone feature earlier this year dubbed Thwaites “The Doomsday Glacier.”) Together, they act as a plug holding back enough ice to pour 11 feet of sea-level rise into the world’s oceans — an amount that would submerge every coastal city on the planet. For that reason, finding out how fast these glaciers will collapse is one of the most important scientific questions in the world today.  To figure that out, scientists have been looking back to the end of the last ice age, about 11,000 years ago, when global temperatures stood at roughly their current levels. The bad news? There’s growing evidence that the Pine Island Bay glaciers collapsed rapidly back then, flooding the world’s coastlines — partially the result of something called “marine ice-cliff instability.”  The ocean floor gets deeper toward the center of this part of Antarctica, so each new iceberg that breaks away exposes taller and taller cliffs. Ice gets so heavy that these taller cliffs can’t support their own weight. Once they start to crumble, the destruction would be unstoppable.  “Ice is only so strong, so it will collapse if these cliffs reach a certain height,” explains Kristin Poinar, a glaciologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “We need to know how fast it’s going to happen.”  In the past few years, scientists have identified marine ice-cliff instability as a feedback loop that could kickstart the disintegration of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet this century — much more quickly than previously thought.  Minute-by-minute, huge skyscraper-sized shards of ice cliffs would crumble into the sea, as tall as the Statue of Liberty and as deep underwater as the height of the Empire State Building. The result: a global catastrophe the likes of which we’ve never seen.  Ice comes in many forms, with different consequences when it melts. Floating ice, like the kind that covers the Arctic Ocean in wintertime and comprises ice shelves, doesn’t raise sea levels. (Think of a melting ice cube, which won’t cause a drink to spill over.)  Land-based ice, on the other hand, is much more troublesome. When it falls into the ocean, it adds to the overall volume of liquid in the seas. Thus, sea-level rise.  Antarctica is a giant landmass — about half the size of Africa — and the ice that covers it averages more than a mile thick. Before human burning of fossil fuels triggered global warming, the continent’s ice was in relative balance: The snows in the interior of the continent roughly matched the icebergs that broke away from glaciers at its edges.  Now, as carbon dioxide traps more heat in the atmosphere and warms the planet, the scales have tipped.  A wholesale collapse of Pine Island and Thwaites would set off a catastrophe. Giant icebergs would stream away from Antarctica like a parade of frozen soldiers. All over the world, high tides would creep higher, slowly burying every shoreline on the planet, flooding coastal cities and creating hundreds of millions of climate refugees.  All this could play out in a mere 20 to 50 years — much too quickly for humanity to adapt.  “With marine ice cliff instability, sea-level rise for the next century is potentially much larger than we thought it might be five or 10 years ago,” Poinar says.  A lot of this newfound concern is driven by the research of two climatologists: Rob DeConto at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and David Pollard at Penn State University. A study they published last year was the first to incorporate the latest understanding of marine ice-cliff instability into a continent-scale model of Antarctica.  Their results drove estimates for how high the seas could rise this century sharply higher. “Antarctic model raises prospect of unstoppable ice collapse,” read the headline in the scientific journal Nature, a publication not known for hyperbole.  Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings. But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario, the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up, their study showed.  Three feet of sea-level rise would be bad, leading to more frequent flooding of U.S. cities such as New Orleans, Houston, New York, and Miami. Pacific Island nations, like the Marshall Islands, would lose most of their territory. Unfortunately, it now seems like three feet is possible only under the rosiest of scenarios.  At six feet, though, around 12 million people in the United States would be displaced, and the world’s most vulnerable megacities, like Shanghai, Mumbai, and Ho Chi Minh City, could be wiped off the map.  At 11 feet, land currently inhabited by hundreds of millions of people worldwide would wind up underwater. South Florida would be largely uninhabitable; floods on the scale of Hurricane Sandy would strike twice a month in New York and New Jersey, as the tug of the moon alone would be enough to send tidewaters into homes and buildings.  DeConto and Pollard’s breakthrough came from trying to match observations of ancient sea levels at shorelines around the world with current ice sheet behavior.  Around 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were about as warm as they’re expected to be later this century, oceans were dozens of feet higher than today.  Previous models suggested that it would take hundreds or thousands of years for sea-level rise of that magnitude to occur. But once they accounted for marine ice-cliff instability, DeConto and Pollard’s model pointed toward a catastrophe if the world maintains a “business as usual” path — meaning we don’t dramatically reduce carbon emissions.  Rapid cuts in greenhouse gases, however, showed Antarctica remaining almost completely intact for hundreds of years.  Pollard and DeConto are the first to admit that their model is still crude, but its results have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode.  “It could happen faster or slower, I don’t think we really know yet,” says Jeremy Bassis, a leading ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan. “But it’s within the realm of possibility, and that’s kind of a scary thing.”  Scientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates. These are, after all, mile-thick chunks of ice.  The new evidence, though, says that once a certain temperature threshold is reached, ice shelves of glaciers that extend into the sea, like those near Pine Island Bay, will begin to melt from both above and below, weakening their structure and hastening their demise, and paving the way for ice-cliff instability to kick in.  In a new study out last month in the journal Nature, a team of scientists from Cambridge and Sweden point to evidence from thousands of scratches left by ancient icebergs on the ocean floor, indicating that Pine Island’s glaciers shattered in a relatively short amount of time at the end of the last ice age.  The only place in the world where you can see ice-cliff instability in action today is at Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland, one of the fastest-collapsing glaciers in the world. DeConto says that to construct their model, they took the collapse rate of Jakobshavn, cut it in half to be extra conservative, then applied it to Thwaites and Pine Island.  But there’s reason to think Thwaites and Pine Island could go even faster than Jakobshavn.  Right now, there’s a floating ice shelf protecting the two glaciers, helping to hold back the flow of ice into the sea. But recent examples from other regions, like the rapidly collapsing Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, show that once ice shelves break apart as a result of warming, their parent glaciers start to flow faster toward the sea, an effect that can weaken the stability of ice further inland, too.  “If you remove the ice shelf, there’s a potential that not just ice-cliff instabilities will start occurring, but a process called marine ice-sheet instabilities,” says Matthew Wise, a polar scientist at the University of Cambridge.  This signals the possible rapid destabilization of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet in this century. “Once the stresses exceed the strength of the ice,” Wise says, “it just falls off.”  And, it’s not just Pine Island Bay. On our current course, other glaciers around Antarctica will be similarly vulnerable. And then there’s Greenland, which could contribute as much as 20 feet of sea-level rise if it melts.  Next to a meteor strike, rapid sea-level rise from collapsing ice cliffs is one of the quickest ways our world can remake itself. This is about as fast as climate change gets.  Still, some scientists aren’t fully convinced the alarm is warranted. Ted Scambos, lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado, says the new research by Wise and his colleagues, which identified ice-cliff instabilities in Pine Island Bay 11,000 years ago, is “tantalizing evidence.” But he says that research doesn’t establish how quickly it happened.  “There’s a whole lot more to understand if we’re going to use this mechanism to predict how far Thwaites glacier and the other glaciers are going to retreat,” he says. “The question boils down to, what are the brakes on this process?”  Scambos thinks it is unlikely that Thwaites or Pine Island would collapse all at once. For one thing, if rapid collapse did happen, it would produce a pile of icebergs that could act like a temporary ice shelf, slowing down the rate of retreat.  Despite the differences of opinion, however, there’s growing agreement within the scientific community that we need to do much more to determine the risk of rapid sea-level rise. In 2015, the U.S. and U.K. governments began to plan a rare and urgent joint research program to study Thwaites glacier. Called “How much, how fast?,” the effort is set to begin early next year and run for five years.  Seeing the two governments pooling their resources is “really a sign of the importance of research like this,” NASA’s Poinar says.  Given what’s at stake, the research program at Thwaites isn’t enough, but it might be the most researchers can get. “Realistically, it’s probably all that can be done in the next five years in the current funding environment,” says Pollard.  He’s referring, of course, to the Trump administration’s disregard for science and adequate scientific funding; the White House’s 2018 budget proposal includes the first-ever cut to the National Science Foundation, which typically funds research in Antarctica.  “It would be sensible to put a huge effort into this, from my perspective,” Pollard says. Structural engineers need to study Antarctica’s key glaciers as though they were analyzing a building, he says, probing for weak spots and understanding how exactly they might fail. “If you vastly increase the research now, [the cost] would still be trivial compared to the losses that might happen.”  Bassis, the ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan, first described the theoretical process of marine ice-cliff instability in research published only a few years ago.  He’s 40 years old, but his field has already changed enormously over the course of his career. In 2002, when Bassis was conducting his PhD research in a different region of Antarctica, he was shocked to return to his base camp and learn that the Larsen B ice shelf had vanished practically overnight.  “Every revision to our understanding has said that ice sheets can change faster than we thought,” he says. “We didn’t predict that Pine Island was going to retreat, we didn’t predict that Larsen B was going to disintegrate. We tend to look at these things after they’ve happened.”  There’s a recurring theme throughout these scientists’ findings in Antarctica: What we do now will determine how quickly Pine Island and Thwaites collapse. A fast transition away from fossil fuels in the next few decades could be enough to put off rapid sea-level rise for centuries. That’s a decision worth countless trillions of dollars and millions of lives.  “The range of outcomes,” Bassis says, “is really going to depend on choices that people make.”  Reporting like this is only possible thanks to the generous support of readers like you.

EAST ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET  This is the last of three dispatches from a New York Times reporting trip to Antarctica.  From the air, the Ross Ice Shelf looks like a vast white plain extending to the horizon. The monochromatic landscape is relieved only occasionally by rocks poking through, or by deep crevasses in the ice itself.  Only at its edge does the ice shelf become something more dramatic: a spectacular sheer cliff rising 100 feet above the ocean and extending 900 feet below the surface. From that cliff edge, icebergs occasionally calve away, completing a thousand-year journey of the ice from land to sea.  Scientists are racing to understand what is happening to the Ross Ice Shelf — and the rest of Antarctica — as the planet warms around it. They are trying to map the thickness of the ice and the shape of the sea floor beneath it in an effort to gauge how vulnerable the shelf may be to collapse, and how soon that could happen.  Scientists are also trying to measure the role of human-caused climate change in weakening some parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and to fathom how damaging the seas around the continent might prove to be as they warm over time.  The edge of the Ross Ice Shelf.  The answers carry profound implications for humanity. In the scientists’ worst-case computer simulations, continued global warming will cause the Ross Ice Shelf to weaken and collapse starting as early as the middle of this century.  Right now, the shelf works like a giant bottle-stopper that slows down ice trying to flow from the land into the sea. If it collapses, the ice could flow into the ocean more rapidly, an effect that has already happened on a much smaller scale in other areas of Antarctica.  The most vulnerable parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet could raise the sea level by 10 to 15 feet, inundating many of the world’s coastal cities, though most scientists think that would take well over a century, or perhaps longer. They are worried about a possible rise of as much as six feet by the end of this century.  Whether these alarming forecasts ultimately prove right depends in part on the shape of the sea floor beneath the ice shelf, and in particular on whether it has deep channels that can funnel warming ocean water under the ice shelf and attack the West Antarctic ice sheet from below. A different undersea topography — high ridges of rock, for example — may keep warmer water out, stabilizing the ice sheet, possibly for hundreds of years.  “We’re hoping to figure out how warm water can get to the edge of the ice sheet,” said Robin E. Bell, head of the Columbia University laboratory that sent a team to survey the Ross Ice Shelf late last year. “What are the sort of hidden roads it can go on?”  As they flew back and forth across the vast white landscape in December, the Columbia scientists used some of the world’s most sophisticated geophysical instruments to see into and beneath the ice. As the hours-long flights wore on, the scientists took turns napping, knitting or eating cold pizza, but at all times, somebody kept close watch on the instruments.  Kirsty J. Tinto, the scientist leading the field team, loved watching as the measurements stripped away the illusion that the ice was just a flat, boring pancake.  “You take a slice through it and you can see a thousand years of history, a hundred million years of history,” she said.  Kirsty J. Tinto steps out of an LC-130 Hercules on the Ross Ice Shelf.  The Ross Ice Shelf appears stable now, so the Columbia project will function somewhat like a doctor’s baseline X-ray — a starting point for comparison if the ice starts to deteriorate.  Satellite evidence suggests that this is already happening in other parts of West Antarctica, and many scientists believe that relatively warm ocean water is the culprit. “It’s kind of a blowtorch on the underside of the ice shelf,” said Robert A. Bindschadler, a retired NASA climate scientist.  But the story is not straightforward, and the warmer water attacking the ice has not been linked to global warming — at least not directly. The winds around the continent seem to be strengthening, stirring the ocean and bringing up a layer of warmer water that has most likely been there for centuries.  Are those stronger winds tied to human-caused global warming? Some scientists think so, but others say the case is unproven. “We’re not sure because we don’t have enough data, for long enough, to separate signal from noise,” said Eric J. Steig, a scientist at the University of Washington who has studied temperature trends in Antarctica.  Though the role of global warming is unclear now, it is likely to be a factor in the relatively near future. Many experts think warmer air temperatures could start to weaken the ice of West Antarctica from above, even as warmer ocean water attacks it from below.  The warmer water seems to be doing the most damage to a series of glaciers that flow into a region of West Antarctica called the Amundsen Sea. Satellites have identified the most rapid loss of ice there, raising a critical question: Has an unstoppable collapse of the ice sheet already begun?  Ross Ice Shelf Pine Island Glacier Thwaites Glacier Ross Sea Amundsen Sea Pine Island Glacier Thwaites Glacier Amundsen Sea Red areas have lost significant amounts of ice since 2010.  The Amundsen Sea region is one of the remotest parts of the continent, far from American and British research bases. Working together, the two countries are planning to devote tens of millions of dollars to getting better measurements there, having decided that it is imperative to begin answering questions about the region’s potential collapse.  For instance, scientists need to know a lot more about the ground beneath the glaciers there. Is it slick mud that may allow the ice to flow much faster, or hard rock that may slow down the ice even in a warmer world?  “What we need to know is really the details of what is occurring where the ice, ocean and land all come together,” said Ted A. Scambos, a University of Colorado scientist who is helping to plan the joint research effort.  Unraveling the answers, and gaining a better understanding of how Antarctica’s ice has waxed and waned in the past, may offer a rough guide to the changes that human-caused global warming could wreak in the future.  Already, scientists know enough to be concerned. About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades.  The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, implying that the ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated, a warning of what could occur in the relatively near future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked.  But some research suggests that a catastrophe might not yet be inevitable. In a study last year, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and David Pollard of Pennsylvania State University used their computer model to predict what would happen if emissions were reduced sharply over the next few decades, in line with international climate goals.  Under the most ambitious scenarios, they found a strong likelihood that Antarctica would remain fairly stable.  “There’s still a chance that all hell will break loose,” Dr. DeConto said. “But the model is suggesting there’s a way to reduce the risk of a big sea-level rise from Antarctica.”",truth
7f8bf578,"Climate Change Is Complex. We’ve Got Answers to Your Questions. President Trump has sometimes claimed that scientists are engaged in a worldwide hoax to fool the public, or that global warming was invented by China to disable American industry. The climate denialists’ arguments have become so strained that even oil and coal companies have distanced themselves publicly, though some still help to finance the campaigns of politicians who espouse such views.  Instead of negotiating over climate change policies and trying to make them more market-oriented, some political conservatives have taken the approach of blocking them by trying to undermine the science.  In theory, they could be. If the sun were to start putting out more radiation, for instance, that would definitely warm the Earth. But scientists have looked carefully at the natural factors known to influence planetary temperature and found that they are not changing nearly enough. The warming is extremely rapid on the geologic time scale, and no other factor can explain it as well as human emissions of greenhouse gases.  Could natural factors be the cause of the warming?  5. Could natural factors be the cause of the warming?  Hard evidence, including studies that use radioactivity to distinguish industrial emissions from natural emissions, shows that the extra gas is coming from human activity. Carbon dioxide levels rose and fell naturally in the long-ago past, but those changes took thousands of years. Geologists say that humans are now pumping the gas into the air much faster than nature has ever done.  How do we know humans are responsible for the increase in carbon dioxide?  4. How do we know humans are responsible for the increase in carbon dioxide?  Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.  In the 19th century, scientists discovered that certain gases in the air trap and slow down heat that would otherwise escape to space. Carbon dioxide is a major player; without any of it in the air, the Earth would be a frozen wasteland. The first prediction that the planet would warm as humans released more of the gas was made in 1896. The gas has increased 43 percent above the pre-industrial level so far, and the Earth has warmed by roughly the amount that scientists predicted it would.  We’ve known about it for more than a century. Really.  What is the greenhouse effect, and how does it cause global warming?  3. What is the greenhouse effect, and how does it cause global warming?  As of early 2017, the Earth had warmed by roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (more than 1 degree Celsius) since 1880, when records began at a global scale. The number may sound low, but as an average over the surface of an entire planet, it is actually high, which explains why much of the world’s land ice is starting to melt and the oceans are rising at an accelerating pace. If greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked, scientists say, the global warming could ultimately exceed 8 degrees Fahrenheit, which would undermine the planet’s capacity to support a large human population.  President Trump has claimed that scientists stopped referring to global warming and started calling it climate change because “the weather has been so cold” in winter. But the claim is false. Scientists have used both terms for decades.  You can think of global warming as one type of climate change. The broader term covers changes beyond warmer temperatures, such as shifting rainfall patterns.  Both are accurate, but they mean different things.  In many other cases, though — hurricanes, for example — the linkage to global warming for particular trends is uncertain or disputed. Scientists are gradually improving their understanding as computer analyses of the climate grow more powerful.  Scientists have published strong evidence that the warming climate is making heat waves more frequent and intense . It is also causing heavier rainstorms , and coastal flooding is getting worse as the oceans rise because of human emissions. Global warming has intensified droughts in regions like the Middle East, and it may have strengthened a recent drought in California.  The risk is that the rate will increase still more. Scientists who study the Earth’s history say waters could rise by a foot per decade in a worst-case scenario, though that looks unlikely. Many experts believe that even if emissions stopped tomorrow, 15 or 20 feet of sea level rise is already inevitable, enough to flood many cities unless trillions of dollars are spent protecting them. How long it will take is unclear. But if emissions continue apace, the ultimate rise could be 80 or 100 feet.  The ocean has accelerated and is now rising at a rate of about a foot per century, forcing governments and property owners to spend tens of billions of dollars fighting coastal erosion. But if that rate continued, it would probably be manageable, experts say.  The simple reality is that people are already feeling the effects, whether they know it or not. Because of sea level rise, for instance, some 83,000 more residents of New York and New Jersey were flooded during Hurricane Sandy than would have been the case in a stable climate, scientists have calculated. Tens of thousands of people are already dying in heat waves made worse by global warming. The refugee flows that have destabilized politics around the world have been traced in part to climate change. Of course, as with almost all other social problems, poor people will be hit first and hardest.  Over the coming 25 or 30 years, scientists say, the climate is likely to gradually warm, with more extreme weather. Coral reefs and other sensitive habitats are already starting to die . Longer term, if emissions rise unchecked, scientists fear climate effects so severe that they might destabilize governments, produce waves of refugees , precipitate the sixth mass extinction of plants and animals in the Earth’s history, and melt the polar ice caps, causing the seas to rise high enough to flood most of the world’s coastal cities. The emissions that create those risks are happening now, raising deep moral questions for our generation.  1. Are there any realistic solutions to the problem?  Yes, but change is happening too slowly.  Society has put off action for so long that the risks are now severe, scientists say. But as long as there are still unburned fossil fuels in the ground, it is not too late to act. The warming will slow to a potentially manageable pace only when human emissions are reduced to zero. The good news is that they are now falling in many countries as a result of programs like fuel-economy standards for cars, stricter building codes and emissions limits for power plants. But experts say the energy transition needs to speed up drastically to head off the worst effects of climate change.  2. What is the Paris Agreement?  Virtually every country agreed to limit future emissions.  The landmark deal was reached outside Paris in December 2015. The reductions are voluntary and the pledges do not do enough to head off severe effects. But the agreement is supposed to be reviewed every few years so that countries ramp up their commitments. President Trump announced in 2017 that he would pull the United States out of the deal, though that will take years, and other countries have said they would go forward regardless of American intentions.  3. Does clean energy help or hurt the economy?  Job growth in renewable energy is strong.  The energy sources with the lowest emissions include wind turbines, solar panels, hydroelectric dams and nuclear power stations. Power plants burning natural gas also produce fewer emissions than those burning coal. Converting to these cleaner sources may be somewhat costlier in the short term, but they could ultimately pay for themselves by heading off climate damages and reducing health problems associated with dirty air. And expansion of the market is driving down the costs of renewable energy so fast that it may ultimately beat dirty energy on price alone — it already does in some areas.  The transition to cleaner energy certainly produces losers, like coal companies, but it also creates jobs. The solar industry in the United States now employs more than twice as many people as coal mining.  4. What about fracking or ‘clean coal’?  Both could help clean up the energy system.  Hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” is one of a set of drilling technologies that has helped produce a new abundance of natural gas in the United States and some other countries. Burning gas instead of coal in power plants reduces emissions in the short run, though gas is still a fossil fuel and will have to be phased out in the long run. The fracking itself can also create local pollution.  “Clean coal” is an approach in which the emissions from coal-burning power plants would be captured and pumped underground. It has yet to be proven to work economically, but some experts think it could eventually play a major role.  5. What’s the latest with electric cars?  Sales are still small overall, but they are rising fast.  The cars draw power at night from the electric grid and give off no pollution during the day as they move around town. They are inherently more efficient than gasoline cars and would represent an advance even if the power were generated by burning coal, but they will be far more important as the electric grid itself becomes greener through renewable power. The cars are improving so fast that some countries are already talking about banning the sale of gasoline cars after 2030.  6. What are carbon taxes, carbon trading and carbon offsets?  It’s just jargon for putting a price on pollution.  The greenhouse gases being released by human activity are often called “carbon emissions” for short. That is because two of the most important gases, carbon dioxide and methane, contain carbon. (Some other pollutants are lumped into the same category, even if they do not actually contain carbon.) When you hear about carbon taxes, carbon trading and so on, these are just shorthand descriptions of methods to put a price on emissions, which economists say is one of the most important steps society could take to limit them.  7. Climate change seems so overwhelming. What can I personally do about it?  Start by sharing this with 50 of your friends.  Experts say the problem can only be solved by large-scale, collective action. Entire states and nations have to decide to clean up their energy systems, using every tool available and moving as quickly as they can. So the most important thing you can do is to exercise your rights as a citizen, speaking up and demanding change.  You can also take direct personal action to reduce your carbon footprint in simple ways that will save you money. You can plug leaks in your home insulation to save power, install a smart thermostat, switch to more efficient light bulbs, turn off unused lights, drive fewer miles by consolidating trips or taking public transit, waste less food, and eat less meat.  Taking one or two fewer plane rides per year can save as much in emissions as all the other actions combined. If you want to be at the cutting edge, you can look at buying an electric or hybrid car or putting solar panels on your roof. If your state has a competitive electricity market, you may be able to buy 100 percent green power.  Leading corporations, including large manufacturers like carmakers, are starting to demand clean energy for their operations. You can pay attention to company policies, support the companies taking the lead, and let the others know you expect them to do better.",truth
6c7718b5,"Global warming to blame for heat records worldwide, as experts warn heatwave will continue Temperature records worldwide have been shattered by an unusual global heatwave.  Stifling heat cracked roads and buckled roofs across Britain last week, as Motherwell hit the highest temperature ever recorded in Scotland at 91.8°F (33.2°C).  The heatwave has spread across the world, with Meteo France placing 21 departments across the country on an orange weather alert, while Oman saw the highest nighttime temperature ever recorded on the planet.  At least eight people have been killed by the stifling heat sweeping North America, with Montreal recording its hottest temperature since records began.  Worse still, the stifling temperatures look set to continue across the Northern Hemisphere, meteorologists have warned.  While an isolated heatwave can be put down as an anomaly, the scale of this phenomenon points to global warming as the culprit, scientists said.  Scroll down for video  Records all around the world have been shattered as the entire planet is in the grips of a vicious heatwave (pictured). Sweltering civilians have been basking in the sun as thermometers record never-before-seen temperatures  Montreal (pictured) smashed the previous record for the city's hottest temperature, as readings from earlier this week showed of 97.9 °F (36.6°C)  In a prolonged and unusually intense bout of sunshine, much of the Northern Hemisphere has experienced uncharacteristically warm temperatures.  The scale of this latest phenomenon suggests global warming is to blame, scientists have cautioned.  'Summers keep getting hotter,' said Friederike Otto of the University of Oxford, who conducted extensive research into data from the heatwave that spread Europe in June, July and August 2017.  'Heatwaves are far more intense than when my parents were growing up in the 1950s.  'If we do nothing to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the kind of extreme heat we saw this past summer will be the norm when my young son is a grown man.'  North America has seen a staggering rise in temperature.  There are already reports of at least eight heat-related deaths in Canada and the United States, stretching back to last weekend, including six in Montreal.  The latter broke the previous record for the city's hottest temperature, as readings from earlier this week showed it reached 97.9 °F (36.6 Celsius).  Denver, the Colorado state capital that famously resides one mile above sea level, also saw a record temperature of 105°F (40.5°C) last week.  That ties with its previous all-time record, which was set July 20 2005.  The swathe of new records are believed to be connected to the intense heat dome that has consumed most of the United States and southeast Canada since late June.  Experts expect the dome to hang over the northeast for at least another week, and predict it will spread west this weekend.  On the other side of the Atlantic ocean, climates are typically milder as a result of the cooling from the Gulf Stream.  But despite this, the summer of 2018 looks set to be one of the hottest on record.  Scotland has experienced the hottest temperature on record, with the UK Met Office reporting Motherwell, which is located some 12 miles (20 km) southeast of Glasgow, hit 91.8°F (33.2°C) on June 28.  The previous Scottish record of 91.2°F (32.9°C) was set in August 2003 at Greycrook.  Additionally, Glasgow had its hottest day on record, hitting 89.4°F (31.9°C).  Over the Irish Sea, temperatures also soared despite cooling breezes rolling off the Atlantic.

Meteorologist Emma Salter told the Daily Express: 'High pressure over the country will slip away on Wednesday and Thursday so it will be a couple of degrees fresher, unfortunately this will be barely noticeable.  'There is another area of high pressure which will take charge later this week and temperatures will creep up towards the weekend when we could be back to 30°C.  'There will be a bit of cloud over the south which might make it feel slightly cooler but this will clear pretty rapidly.  'Then we are back to stunning blue skies and sunshine and there is no sign of this weather breaking right up until the middle of July which is unusual.  'The long-range trend is for above-average temperatures staying until the end of July with only a couple of changeable spells in this period.'  Public health England (PHE) has issued a level two health warning with regards to the unusual heat.  HOW HOT HAS EUROPE BEEN IN THE HEATWAVE? Excessive heat scorched the British Isles last week.

4d40e3aa,"Alaska’s Permafrost Is Thawing YUKON DELTA NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, Alaska — The Arctic is warming about twice as fast as other parts of the planet, and even here in sub-Arctic Alaska the rate of warming is high. Sea ice and wildlife habitat are disappearing; higher sea levels threaten coastal native villages.  But to the scientists from Woods Hole Research Center who have come here to study the effects of climate change, the most urgent is the fate of permafrost, the always-frozen ground that underlies much of the state.  Starting just a few feet below the surface and extending tens or even hundreds of feet down, it contains vast amounts of carbon in organic matter — plants that took carbon dioxide from the atmosphere centuries ago, died and froze before they could decompose. Worldwide, permafrost is thought to contain about twice as much carbon as is currently in the atmosphere.  Once this ancient organic material thaws, microbes convert some of it to carbon dioxide and methane, which can flow into the atmosphere and cause even more warming. Scientists have estimated that the process of permafrost thawing could contribute as much as 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit to global warming over the next several centuries, independent of what society does to reduce emissions from burning fossil fuels and other activities.  In Alaska, nowhere is permafrost more vulnerable than here, 350 miles south of the Arctic Circle, in a vast, largely treeless landscape formed from sediment brought down by two of the state’s biggest rivers, the Yukon and the Kuskokwim. Temperatures three feet down into the frozen ground are less than half a degree below freezing. This area could lose much of its permafrost by midcentury.  That, said Max Holmes, senior scientist and deputy director of the research center, “has all kinds of consequences both locally for this region, for the animals and the people who live here, as well as globally.”  “It’s sobering to think of this magnificent landscape and how fundamentally it can change over a relatively short time period,” he added.  But on this wide, flat tundra, it takes a practiced eye to see how Alaska is thawing from below.  At one of the countless small lakes that pepper the region, chunks of shoreline that include what had been permafrost have calved off toward the water.  Nearby, across a spongy bed of mosses and lichens, a small boggy depression most likely formed when the ice in the top layers of the permafrost below it melted to water.  In the field, Sarah Ludwig, a Woods Hole research assistant (left), and a student, Laura Jardine, extract a core of permafrost. In the lab, Ms. Jardine cuts the core with a saw. Stash Wislocki, except for last photo, by John Schade  In July, the Woods Hole scientists, along with 13 undergraduate and graduate students working on projects of their own, set up a temporary field station on a nameless lake 60 miles northwest of Bethel, which with a population of 6,000 is the largest town in the region. They drilled permafrost cores with a power auger, took other sediment and water samples and embedded temperature probes in the frozen ground. Later, back in the lab at Woods Hole, they began the process of analyzing the samples for carbon content and nutrients.  The goal is to better understand how thawing permafrost affects the landscape and, ultimately, how much and what mix of greenhouse gases is released.  “In order to know how much is lost, you have to know how much is there,” said Sue Natali, a Woods Hole scientist and permafrost expert.  Even in colder northern Alaska, where permafrost in some parts of the North Slope extends more than 2,100 feet below the surface, scientists are seeing stark changes. Vladimir E. Romanovsky, a permafrost researcher at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, said that temperatures at a depth of 65 feet have risen by 3 degrees Celsius (about 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit) over decades.  Near-surface changes have been even greater. At one northern site, he said, permafrost temperatures at shallow depths have climbed from minus 8 degrees Celsius to minus 3.  “Minus 3 is not that far from zero,” Dr. Romanovsky said. If emissions and warming continue at the same rate, he said, near-surface temperatures will rise above freezing around the middle of the century.  There is plenty of debate among scientists about when and how much of Alaska’s permafrost will thaw. And there is no doubt that thawing of the full depth of permafrost would take millenniums.  But Dr. Romanovsky said that his and others’ work shows that permafrost “is not as stable as people thought.”  In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, thawing wreaks havoc on infrastructure, causing slumping of land when ice loses volume as it turns to water.  The main road in Bethel, where average temperatures have risen about 4 degrees Fahrenheit since the mid-20th century, is more of a washboard than a thoroughfare because of shifting ground. Building foundations in Bethel move and crack as well. Some roads, airport runways and parking areas have to be reinforced with liquid-filled pipes that transfer heat out of the permafrost to keep the ground from slumping.  The thawing of permafrost is a gradual process. Ground is fully frozen in winter, and begins to thaw from the top down as air temperatures rise in spring. As average temperatures increase over years, this thawed, or active, layer can increase in depth.  At the field station, the researchers are especially interested in how wildfires affect the permafrost. Because burning removes some of the vegetation that acts as insulation, the theory is that burning should cause permafrost to thaw more.  In the field, Sarah Ludwig, a Woods Hole research assistant (left), and a student, Laura Jardine, extract a core of permafrost. In the lab, Ms. Jardine cuts the core with a saw. Stash Wislocki, except for last photo, by John Schade  In the field, Sarah Ludwig, a Woods Hole research assistant (left), and a student, Laura Jardine, extract a core of permafrost. In the lab, Ms. Jardine cuts the core with a saw. Stash Wislocki, except for last photo, by John Schade  Parts of the tundra here burned in the 1970s and in the summer of 2015, so the researchers took cores from both burned and unburned areas. Scientists wrestled with the bulky power auger as its stainless steel tube worked its way into the hard permafrost. Cores — often containing thin layers of solid ice — were labeled, packed in a cooler and sent by helicopter to a freezer in Bethel.  Thawing permafrost underneath or at the edge of a lake can cause it to drain like a leaky bathtub. Thawing elsewhere can bring about small elevation changes that can in turn lead to changes in water flow through the landscape, drying out some parts of the tundra and turning others into bogs.  Beyond the local effects on plant and animal life, the landscape changes can have an important climate change impact, by altering the mix of carbon dioxide and methane that is emitted. Although methane does not persist in the atmosphere for as long as carbon dioxide, it has a far greater heat-trapping ability and can contribute to more rapid warming.  So the researchers devote much of their time to studying the flow of water and the carbon and nutrients it contains.  “It’s one of the big questions to tackle – what’s wet and dry now, and what will be wet and dry in the future,” Dr. Natali said. If the decomposing permafrost is wet, there will be less oxygen available to the microbes, so they will produce more methane. If the permafrost is dry, the decomposition will lead to more carbon dioxide.  Estimates vary on how much carbon is currently released from thawing permafrost worldwide, but by one calculation emissions over the rest of the century could average about 1.5 billion tons a year, or about the same as current annual emissions from fossil-fuel burning in the United States.  Already, thawing permafrost and warmer temperatures are being blamed for rising carbon emissions in the Alaskan tundra, both here and farther north. In a study earlier this year, researchers found that bacterial decomposition of thawed permafrost, as well as carbon dioxide produced by living vegetation, continues later into the fall because freezing of the surface is delayed.  The rise in emissions has been so significant, the researchers found, that Alaska may be shifting from a sink, or storehouse, of carbon, to a net source.  Dr. Holmes said that shift was not surprising given the climate trend, and he would expect that sub-Arctic parts of Siberia, Canada and other areas with permafrost may be undergoing similar changes.  “There’s a massive amount of carbon that’s in the ground, that’s built up slowly over thousands and thousands of years,” he said.  “It’s been in a freezer, and that freezer is now turning into a refrigerator.”  Correction August 23, 2017 An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to an estimate of the amount of carbon released from thawing permafrost worldwide. It is 1.5 billion tons a year averaged over the remainder of the century, not 1.5 billions tons a year currently. Correction August 25, 2017 An earlier version of this article misspelled, in one instance, the surname of a permafrost researcher at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. He is Vladimir E.

Data provided by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts on behalf of the EU, showed that the global average temperature for June 2019 was the highest on record for the month.  The data showed European average ​temperatures were more than 2C above normal and temperatures were 6-10C above normal over most of France, Germany and northern Spain during the final days of the month, according to C3S.  The global average temperature was about 0.1C higher than during the previous warmest June in 2016.  Experts have said climate change made last week’s record-breaking European heatwave at least five times as likely to happen, according to recent analysis.

Spikes in European average temperatures of more than 1C above normal have occurred before, such as in 1917 and 1999, but C3S said the recent heatwave was notable because the sudden increase came on top of a general rise of around 1.5C in European temperature over the past 100 years.  In response to the record-breaking heat, Professor Hannah Cloke, natural hazards researcher at the University of Reading, said: “We knew June was hot in Europe, but this study shows that temperature records haven’t just been broken. They have been obliterated.  “This is the hottest June on record in Europe by a country mile, and the warmest June we have ever seen globally.  “Heatwaves occur in any climate, but we know that heatwaves are becoming much more likely due to climate change. The global climate just keeps getting hotter, as greenhouse gases continue to build up, as scientists have predicted for decades.”  However, she added: “Rapid attempts to find links between climate change and single extreme weather events are possible, but often come with many caveats. We should be careful not to ignore these caveats when we look at the conclusions of quick-turnaround attribution studies.”  *A previous headline on this story suggested June was the hottest month ever recorded.

feaf1f09,"Ross McKitrick: All those warming-climate predictions suddenly have a big, new problem Share this Story: Ross McKitrick: All those warming-climate predictions suddenly have a big, new problem  Ross McKitrick: All those warming-climate predictions suddenly have a big, new problem Junk Science Week: Looking at the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity measurements, it might not get as hot some people seem to think Photo by Getty Images  Article content One of the most important numbers in the world goes by the catchy title of Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity, or ECS. It is a measure of how much the climate responds to greenhouse gases. More formally, it is defined as the increase, in degrees Celsius, of average temperatures around the world, after doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and allowing the atmosphere and the oceans to adjust fully to the change. The reason it’s important is that it is the ultimate justification for governmental policies to fight climate change. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says ECS is likely between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius, but it can’t be more precise than that. Which is too bad, because an enormous amount of public policy depends on its value. People who study the impacts of global warming have found that if ECS is low — say, less than two — then the impacts of global warming on the economy will be mostly small and, in many places, mildly beneficial. If it is very low, for instance around one, it means greenhouse gas emissions are simply not worth doing anything about. But if ECS is high — say, around four degrees or more — then climate change is probably a big problem. We may not be able to stop it, but we’d better get ready to adapt to it.

Article content So, somebody, somewhere, ought to measure ECS. As it turns out, a lot of people have been trying, and what they have found has enormous policy implications. To understand why, we first need to delve into the methodology a bit. There are two ways scientists try to estimate ECS. The first is to use a climate model, double the modeled CO2 concentration from the pre-industrial level, and let it run until temperatures stabilize a few hundred years into the future. This approach, called the model-based method, depends for its accuracy on the validity of the climate model, and since models differ quite a bit from one another, it yields a wide range of possible answers. A well-known statistical distribution derived from modeling studies summarizes the uncertainties in this method. It shows that ECS is probably between two and 4.5 degrees, possibly as low as 1.5 but not lower, and possibly as high as nine degrees. This range of potential warming is very influential on economic analyses of the costs of climate change. The second method is to use long-term historical data on temperatures, solar activity, carbon-dioxide emissions and atmospheric chemistry to estimate ECS using a simple statistical model derived by applying the law of conservation of energy to the planetary atmosphere. This is called the Energy Balance method. It relies on some extrapolation to satisfy the definition of ECS but has the advantage of taking account of the available data showing how the actual atmosphere has behaved over the past 150 years.  Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.  Article content The surprising thing is that the Energy Balance estimates are very low compared to model-based estimates. The accompanying chart compares the model-based range to ECS estimates from a dozen Energy Balance studies over the past decade. Clearly these two methods give differing answers, and the question of which one is more accurate is important. Climate modelers have put forward two explanations for the discrepancy. One is called the “emergent constraint” approach. The idea is that models yield a range of ECS values, and while we can’t measure ECS directly, the models also yield estimates of a lot of other things that we can measure (such as the reflectivity of cloud tops), so we could compare those other measures to the data, and when we do, sometimes the models with high ECS values also yield measures of secondary things that fit the data better than models with low ECS values. This argument has been a bit of a tough sell, since the correlations involved are often weak, and it doesn’t explain why the Energy Balance results are so low. The second approach is based on so-called “forcing efficacies,” which is the concept that climate forcings, such as greenhouse gases and aerosol pollutants, differ in their effectiveness over time and space, and if these variations are taken into account the Energy Balance sensitivity estimates may come out higher. This, too, has been a controversial suggestion. A recent Energy Balance ECS estimate was just published in the Journal of Climate by Nicholas Lewis and Judith Curry. There are several features that make their study especially valuable. First, they rely on IPCC estimates of greenhouse gases, solar changes and other climate forcings, so they can’t be accused of putting a finger on the scale by their choice of data. Second, they take into account the efficacy issue and discuss it at length. They also take into account recent debates about how surface temperatures should or shouldn’t be measured, and how to deal with areas like the Arctic where data are sparse. Third, they compute their estimates over a variety of start and end dates to check that their ECS estimate is not dependent on the relative warming hiatus of the past two decades.  Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.  Article content It looks like the climate models we have been using for decades need to be revised Their ECS estimate is 1.5 degrees, with a probability range between 1.05 and 2.45 degrees. If the study was a one-time outlier we might be able to ignore it. But it is part of a long list of studies from independent teams (as this interactive graphic shows), using a variety of methods that take account of critical challenges, all of which conclude that climate models exhibit too much sensitivity to greenhouse gases. Policy-makers need to pay attention, because this debate directly impacts the carbon-tax discussion. The Environmental Protection Agency uses social cost of carbon models that rely on the model-based ECS estimates. Last year, two colleagues and I published a study in which we took an earlier Lewis and Curry ECS estimate and plugged it into two of those models. The result was that the estimated economic damages of greenhouse gas emissions fell by between 40 and 80 per cent, and in the case of one model the damages had a 40 per cent probability of being negative for the next few decades — that is, they would be beneficial changes. The new Lewis and Curry ECS estimate is even lower than their old one, so if we re-did the same study we would find even lower social costs of carbon. If ECS is as low as the Energy Balance literature suggests, it means that the climate models we have been using for decades run too hot and need to be revised. It also means that greenhouse gas emissions do not have as big an impact on the climate as has been claimed, and the case for costly policy measures to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions is much weaker than governments have told us. For a science that was supposedly “settled” back in the early 1990s, we sure have a lot left to learn.

4852bd38,"Vanuatu's president makes a leap in tying Cyclone Pam to climate change After Category 5 Cyclone Pam tore his country apart, prompting a humanitarian emergency, Vanuatu's President Baldwin Lonsdale pinned at least part of the blame for the islands' predicament on manmade global warming.  The storm, which struck with a ferocity the country had not experienced before in modern history, had sustained winds of 165 miles per hour, with gusts exceeding 200 miles per hour when it roared through the tiny country. It leveled homes and businesses, and stripped trees bare on the most populated island of Efate, including the capital of Port Vila. The death toll stood at 24 on Tuesday, but it is expected to rise as more information begins streaming in from outlying islands that have been cut off from the outside world.  “This is a very devastating cyclone … I term it a monster that has hit Vanuatu,” Lonsdale said at a U.N. disaster summit in Japan, according to The Guardian. “It is a setback for the government and for the people of Vanuatu. … All the development that has taken place has been wiped out.”  He said the cyclone seasons that the nation had experienced were the result of climate change. “We see the level of sea rise … the cyclone seasons, the warm, the rain, all this is affected,” he said.  So, is the president correct to link the devastating cyclone to global warming? Or is the tie so tenuous that it's almost nonexistent? The answer, as it often is in climate science, is far more nuanced than Vanuatu's president portrays it.  Scientists say unusually mild sea surface temperatures and added atmospheric water vapor helped the storm intensify before slamming into Vanuatu. At the same time, rising sea levels likely made the storm more damaging than it would have been just a few decades ago.  Here are the main factors to consider when analyzing the potential ties between Cyclone Pam and the warming climate.  Ocean temperatures are the main suspect  Scientists Mashable contacted said the storm intensified rapidly before hitting Vanuatu, aided by an area of unusually mild ocean waters and favorable atmospheric conditions. Ocean temperatures in the area where the cyclone intensified were up to 2 degrees Celsius above average for this time of year (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).  Some — but not all — of the sea surface temperature anomalies in the Southwest Pacific Ocean are likely related to global warming, according to Kevin Trenberth, a climate researcher with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, as well as other experts.  Global sea surface temperatures, showing an area of extremely warm water near Vanuatu and Australia. Image: NOAA/ESRL  According to Trenberth, about about 0.6 degrees Celsius, or 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit, of the ocean temperature anomalies can be blamed on human-induced global warming while the rest is natural and associated with an ongoing El Niño event in the tropical Pacific Ocean.  El Niño is a climate phenomenon that features warmer than average ocean temperatures in much of the tropical Pacific Ocean. It can alter worldwide weather patterns, including tropical cyclone seasons in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.  Whatever the cause, though, the warm ocean waters can supercharge storms like Cyclone Pam, as more evaporation takes place and moisture is added to the air.  The atmosphere all around there has some 10 to 20% more moisture in it than a comparable storm in the 1970s would have had. The high sea surface temperatures and the water vapor fueled the storm and undoubtedly increased its intensity and size, Trenberth said in an email conversation. The winds are stronger, the storm surge is greater on higher sea levels.  El Niño has played a role here on top of global warming. But strong storms can certainly occur in that region anyway (but not this strong). The sea surface temperatures are over 86 degrees Fahrenheit for heaven's sake, he said.  An analysis of long-term trends in sea surface temperatures in the region where Cyclone Pam rapidly intensified into a Category 5 monster shows that there has been a warming trend since 1948, although there are considerable uncertainties in this data, says Michael Ventrice, an operational meteorologist at WSI Corporation in Massachusetts. He said it is not clear from the data whether the higher temperatures were a result of natural variations or human effects.  Sea surface temperature departures from average in the vicinity of Vanuatu and Australia as of March 16, 2015. Image: WeatherbellAnalytics  The bottom line point is that there has been a long-term warming trend observed in the location where Pam intensified, Ventrice said.  Madden and Julian...  Ventrice says Cyclone Pam thrived in an environment that was well-suited to explosive intensification. These environmental factors included the warm ocean waters that extended deep into the ocean, as well as a natural weather cycle known as the Madden Julian Oscillation, or MJO.  In certain instances, the MJO can encourage the air to rise, forming thunderstorms as well as tropical cyclones. Think of the MJO as a helping hand that likely aided the storm's rapid intensification.  The MJO acts to moisten the middle and upper-levels of the atmosphere and reduce vertical wind shear, both are which parameters that are musts for intensification, Ventrice said.  Few robust trends in tropical cyclones near Vanuatu  Climate research has shown that tropical cyclones in many ocean basins are becoming stronger and lasting longer than they used to. However, the Southwest Pacific, where Cyclone Pam occurred, is not one of these areas, possibly due to the relative paucity of data there.  Kerry Emanuel, a meteorologist at MIT who is a prominent researcher examining global warming-related trends in tropical storms and hurricanes, told Mashable that not much can be said about trends in the vicinity of Vanuatu.  Ironically, this is a part of the world where we do not observe any significant upward trends in tropical cyclone metrics, and few models predict upward trends there as a consequence of global warming, he said in an email.  In a post for the blog Realclimate on March 18, Emanuel wrote that there are signs that some parameters of severe tropical cyclones are changing, even in areas like the Southwest Pacific basin where data is relatively sparse.  While Pam and Haiyan, as well as other recent tropical cyclone disasters, cannot be uniquely pinned on global warming, they have no doubt been influenced by natural and anthropogenic climate change and they do remind us of our continuing vulnerability to such storms, Emanuel said.  Tom Knutson, a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says that of the six ocean basins that give rise to tropical cyclones, the Southwest Pacific basin is an area that shows the least tendency for an increase in storm activity by the end of the century. In fact, there may be a decrease in cyclone frequency or intensity there, based on the most recent computer model simulations, Knutson says.  James Elsner, a professor at Florida State University who has been investigating how global warming may be altering the strongest storms on Earth, says he would be surprised if South Pacific storms were not growing stronger, like storms elsewhere. But the data is not yet there to prove it.  We have a pretty solid basis (physical & empirical) for our understanding that ocean heat makes the strongest tropical cyclones stronger, he said. Empirically it has been shown for the global as a whole and for the North Atlantic. But the signal is hard to see in noisy data, and especially where confounded by a trend toward fewer cyclones.  Although global warming signals may not be present yet, multiple studies have shown that manmade global warming is likely to cause tropical cyclones (including hurricanes and typhoons) to be more intense, on average, than they are today, which means these storms will be more destructive. Manmade warming is also likely to lead to an uptick in the number of extremely intense tropical cyclones in some ocean basins during the next several decades, according to peer reviewed research.  Since sea-level rise is already making cyclones more destructive by giving them a higher launching pad for storm surge flooding, this means that future storms may be an order of magnitude more damaging than what we typically experience today.  As a small, low-lying island nation, Vanuatu is acutely aware of rising sea levels due to global warming. Along with other small island countries, some of which were affected by the same cyclone, Vanuatu has lobbied the U.N. in favor of steep greenhouse gas emissions cuts to reduce the severity of climate change, seeing it as a matter of its very survival as a nation.",truth
ebd188a7,"How Hurricane Patricia became the strongest hurricane so quickly Hurricane Patricia, which is threatening the coast of western Mexico with a catastrophic impact, intensified at rates that were among the fastest scientists have seen anywhere on Earth. The storm went from 60 mph winds to 200 mph in just 30 hours.  By early Friday morning, the storm was the most intense hurricane ever recorded in either the eastern Pacific or entire North Atlantic basin, which also includes the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean.  It's no coincidence that this storm exploded in an area of near-record warm sea surface temperatures that had not yet been tapped by any other recent storms. It's also an area where atmospheric conditions were favorable for such a storm to strengthen.  Consider this: As of 5 a.m. ET on Thursday, the storm had 85 mile-per-hour winds and a minimum central air pressure of 980 millibars. By 5 a.m. ET on Friday, the winds increased to 200 miles per hour, with an air pressure of 880 millibars.  That's an astonishing 100 millibar drop in air pressure in a 24-hour period, which is virtually unheard of. The intensification rate looked like a steep staircase when graphed using a satellite-based computer algorithm that tracks storm intensity.  Chart indicates the rapid intensification rate of Hurricane Patricia. Image: University of Wisconsin  A period of rapid intensification was forecast by most hurricane prediction models, though none foresaw the sheer ferocity that the storm would eventually achieve.  While scientists have made great strides in recent years in understanding what factors cause hurricanes and typhoons to rapidly intensify, there remain some mysteries about this process.  Based on email conversations Mashable had with a half dozen tropical cyclone experts on Friday morning, here's what we know so far.  Warm water served as fuel  The storm exploded over an area of exceptional ocean warmth, with waters of 1 to 2 degrees Celsius above average for this time of year. In addition, the atmospheric conditions in this area were ideally suited for a rapidly strengthening storm, with what is known as thermodynamic potential intensity readings at a maximum. This occurred right in the area where Patricia spun its way into the record books on Friday morning.  The ocean warmth is largely due to a near-record strong El Niño event, which has not only raised ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific, but has also caused those warm waters to extend deeper below the surface than is usually the case, which also helps storms to intensify.  Sea surface temperature anomaly in the area where Hurricane Patricia intensified. Image: WeatherBell Analytics  In addition, most of the storms that have formed so far this year — and there have been a record number in the eastern tropical Pacific — have formed well west of where Patricia spun up. These left plenty of undisturbed warm water, which is fuel for a storm like this.  Basically that area closer to Mexico usually has a lot more tropical cyclones nearby, said Eric Blake, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Since they were all much farther west, Patricia ended up moving over very warm, untapped waters with the rest of the conditions quite ripe.  Cooperative atmosphere  Ryan Maue, a meteorologist for the private weather firm WeatherBell Analytics, said alarm bells were ringing on Thursday based on computer model indications that the storm would intensify quickly.

He said the fact that Patricia is a small storm, with a compact inner core of intense thunderstorms, helped it to deepen pressure within a tiny radius of maximum wind. (The storm is smaller, in area, than Super Typhoon Haiyan and Hurricane Katrina.)  Maue also noted that the ocean temperatures the storm is tapping into are the warmest left in the entire northern hemisphere at this date, at about 31 degrees Celsius, or 88 degrees Fahrenheit.  But is this intensification rate an indication of how global warming is altering the characteristics and behavior of nature's most powerful storms? That's a harder question to answer at this point, scientists told Mashable.  Tropical cyclone potential intensity as of Oct. 19, 2015, showing the highest value near where Hurricane Patricia intensified. Image: Kerry Emanuel  Kerry Emanuel, a hurricane expert at MIT, said the lack of a consistent record of eastern Pacific storms using hurricane hunter flights makes it difficult to determine if there is a global warming-related trend in such storms. Such flights are typically flown in the Atlantic and only occasionally in the eastern Pacific, so this was an exceptional case.  There is no question that this is an exceptionally intense tropical cyclone, he wrote. But I wonder whether we really know that prior storms in the region have not been equally intense and we are just lucky to have measured this one.  Global warming considerations  Maue, for his part, said hurricanes tend to respond to more localized conditions when intensifying or weakening, rather than global trends.  Hurricanes respond locally, and rapid/explosive intensification changes due to climate change could be a result but hard to say with just one storm during a strong El Niño, he wrote.  Kevin Trenberth, a senior climate researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, said the unusually mild ocean temperatures are allowing more moisture to flow into the storm, which adds fuel to the fire.  Trenberth's research has shown that global warming has increased the available water vapor for storms around the world, which plays a role in everything from more intense local downpours to hurricanes.  The moisture flowing into the storm, that provides its primary fuel, must be higher than it has ever been before, he wrote. It still requires the right setup to convert that into an intense storm, but the environment is surely ripe. That consists, of course, of a substantial El Niño-related component, but also the background global warming that has a memory through the ocean heat content.  According to Trenberth, El Niño has redistributed ocean heat across the tropical Pacific, putting a bullseye of heat right underneath Hurricane Patricia.  This is the warmest large-scale spot in the hemisphere, Trenberth said. This causes moisture to rush toward that area from relatively cooler ocean waters around it.  Sea levels off the coast of Mexico are about 8 inches above average because of the warm bulge of water (water expands as it is heated). The subsurface ocean is exceptionally warm as well as the sea surface, he said.  It's not just El Niño that's boosting ocean temperatures in the eastern Pacific, either. Other natural climate cycles are contributing too, according to hurricane researcher Gabriel Vecchi of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey.  To answer which factors was dominant, and by how much, would take a systematic analysis — so I don't think I'm willing to shoot for the hip to tell you which ones are important this year, much less for this particular storm, he said. But it's my opinion that there will be time, and there are ways, to assess the impacts of these factors in the future.  According to Vecchi, projections do show that global warming will increase ocean temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific, which could bring more hurricanes like this one.  Tom Knutson, who works in Princeton with Vecchi, told Mashable that a new study shows that the northeast Pacific basin, where Hurricane Patricia is located, will have the largest future increase in the frequency of Category 4 and 5 storms of anywhere on Earth, which he says is probably just a coincidence.  He said computer modeling studies that he and his colleagues have published show that manmade warming will increase storm intensities in the future, and that this trend may already have begun to a small extent in the northeast Pacific.  Knutson cautioned that observations of northeast Pacific storms do not show such a trend yet, at least for the period from 1982 to 2009.",truth
56696255,"Here’s why it's so frickin’ hot right now There's something about a warm February day that reminds you that something just isn't right. It gives you that nagging feeling that maybe global warming is real after all.  February 2017 has featured prolonged warm weather the likes of which many areas have not seen before, or have only experienced on rare occasions.  Taken as a whole, the month-to-date in the U.S. has seen a ridiculously lopsided ratio of daily record highs to daily record lows, which is a key indicator of short-term weather variability and, over the longer term, human-caused climate change.  For individual days' worth of warm weather, you mainly have the jet stream to thank. This current of fast-moving air at about 35,000 feet above the ground has been steering a never-ending series storms into the West Coast, where California's mountains have picked up a crazy 500 inches of snow so far, and then moved across the U.S. in a way that has cut off flow of frigid air from the Arctic.  While transient weather variability is playing a key role here, the widespread record warmth across the U.S. so far this year is part of a long-term trend toward more warm temperature records versus cold ones.  Me enjoying this weather but knowing our Earth is danger pic.twitter.com/Jy6bINvZ6C — breanna (@bre_lliant) February 19, 2017  This February offers a vivid illustration of this trend.  Through Feb. 23, daily record highs have been blowing away daily record lows by a far greater than 100-to-1 ratio, which, if it holds for a few more days, would itself set a record. So far this month, there have been nearly 5,000 daily record highs set or tied, compared to just 42 daily record lows. (Although this records ratio might need an asterisk, considering the short calendar month.)  And it's not the daily records that are most impressive, but rather the number of monthly records that are being tied or broken from the Gulf Coast all the way to the Midwest and northeastward into Canada. During the past week alone (not including Feb. 23), there were 736 daily record highs set or tied in the U.S., compared to zero daily record lows for the same period.  Even more startling is the number of record warm overnight temperatures set or tied in the past seven days, which total a whopping 940. There were no record cold overnight low temperatures set or tied during the same period.  And the monthly records, which are far harder to break than daily milestones, are astounding.  Temperature anomaly across North America for Feb. 19 as seen through the GFS computer model. Image: weatherbell analytics  According to the National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) in Asheville, North Carolina, February has seen 336 monthly record highs set or tied, along with 203 records set or tied for the warmest overnight minimum temperature. In comparison, there was not a single monthly cold temperature record set or tied through Feb. 23.  These figures do not include monthly temperature records that were broken on Friday, which included 73 degrees in Boston, shattering the previous record by 3 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, Allentown, Pennsylvania hit a remarkable 77 degrees, and Binghamton, New York reached 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Dayton, Cincinatti and Columbus Ohio each either tied or broke their monthly high temperature records on Friday as well, with numerous monthly milestones set on Thursday, too.  In Albany, New York, the high temperature of 74 degrees on Thursday was the warmest temperature on record for any day during the months of December, January and February.

As of 11:29 am today (2/25) we are at 66! #ThatDidNotLastLong #vtwx — NWS Burlington (@NWSBurlington) February 25, 2017  On Wednesday, the record warmth was centered across the Midwest, where the three major cities in Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Madison and Green Bay), all saw temperatures hit record highs for not just February, but for any month during meteorological winter, which encompasses the months of December, January and February.  Milwaukee, for example, broke its monthly all-time record high for February when the temperature reached 71 degrees Fahrenheit, and Madison set a monthly record with a high of 68 degrees Fahrenheit.  Chicago hit 70° today for the 5th time during Feb. since 1871. Also happened Saturday. Highest Feb. temp of 75° (2/27/1976) in jeopardy Wed. — NWS Chicago (@NWSChicago) February 20, 2017  In Ottumwa, Iowa, where the ground would normally be snow-covered this time of year, the high on Wednesday was 79 degrees, which set a monthly record as well. Some cities set records for the longest stretch of February warmth they've seen, including Kansas City, which set a seven-day February warmth record on Wednesday, according to weather.com.  On Monday, Chicago had a high temperature of 70 degrees, which was only the fifth time that has happened in any February in the Windy City. (The fourth time also came this February.)  The warm weather in the Midwest was enabled by a marked lack of snow cover and lake ice across the Great Lakes, which allowed air temperatures to soar on mild southwesterly winds for days on end. As of Feb. 22, just 19.1 percent of the lower 48 states were snow-covered, far below average for this time of year.  While cold air is staging a comeback across the Midwest, where heavy snow is predicted to fall from Nebraska into Wisconsin, much of the South and East is likely to stay milder than average for at least a few more days.  Where's the snow? Image: noaa  The warm weather in the U.S. hasn't been a freak phenomenon only occurring for the past few weeks, either. The year-to-date is averaging a record daily highs to record daily lows ratio of more than 4-to-1, and studies have shown that over the past several decades, human-caused global warming has increased the odds of warm temperature records so that these ratios are becoming more and more skewed.  And the warmth isn't just limited to the U.S., either, with the planet recording its 3rd-warmest January on record, after its warmest year so far in 2016. This continues the long-term warming of about 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit since reliable surface temperatures began in 1880.  As the planet warms in response to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the ratio of high temperature records compared to low temperature records has become more skewed. If the climate weren't warming, that long-term ratio should average out to about 1-to-1.  However, that isn't the world we're living in. A 2009 study found that the record highs to lows ratio was 2-to-1 for the lower 48 states during the 2000s, and this disparity has only grown since then, though not evenly across every part of the country. Projections show the imbalance increasing in coming decades as global warming continues, possibly to as high as 15-to-1 if emissions of planet-warming pollutants such as carbon dioxide continue apace.  One thing I remind myself when comparing contemporary events to trends or patterns is that the contemporary events themselves make up the trends and patterns, said Deke Arndt, who leads the climate monitoring branch at NCEI. This is a real-time view into what we will call recent trends in a few years.  This week has been an up close look at the DNA of what we are seeing in the big picture: relative to historical norms, extreme heat continues to outpace extreme cold across almost every place, season and time of day in the USA.  While individual months will still vary from this trend, it's clear that over the long-term, the ratio of record highs to record lows is now strongly favoring record highs as well as record warm overnight temperatures. This is consistent with computer model projections of a warming world.  In other words, if you like 70-degree February days in Washington, D.C., you're in luck.  The odds are (increasingly) ever in your favor.",truth
b27e8cff,"Great Barrier Reef may perish by 2030s as ocean temperatures skyrocket, study finds Australia's Great Barrier Reef is one of the world's greatest reservoirs of biodiversity.  A World Heritage site, it is currently under assault from unusually hot ocean temperatures, which is causing widespread coral bleaching that is damaging and, in some cases, even killing the reefs.  Now a new study by scientists at the Australian Research Council finds that the ongoing bleaching event is mainly due to human-caused global warming, and that if global warming proceeds as currently expected, large parts of the Great Barrier Reef could die by the mid-2030s.  The study has not yet been submitted for peer review in a scientific journal. And until this study is reviewed and published in a scientific journal, its results should be treated as preliminary, but consistent with other recent climate science research.  The study examines what has caused ocean temperatures to spike to record highs in the Coral Sea region, which encompasses much of the Great Barrier Reef, including the hardest-hit northern reaches.    This area has recorded a big increase in temperatures over the past century, with March 2016 being the warmest on record, the researchers wrote in a piece published at The Conversation on Thursday, a website that publishes academic works.  Coral bleaching occurs when coral expels the algae that lives in its tissue, giving it color and nutrients. This action, caused by stresses such as increased water temperature and pollution, leaves the coral skeleton exposed, making it more susceptible to heat stress, disease and pollution.  Sea surface temperatures in March 2016. Image: Mitchell Black    The analysis used methods that have also been used to analyze other extreme weather and climate events, including record heat waves and extreme precipitation events.  The scientists found that human-caused global warming made the record warm ocean temperatures and related bleaching events seen this year at least 175 times more likely to occur. The analysis found that climate change increased ocean temperatures by 1 degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, during March.  Coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016. Image: Catlin Seaview Survey  The study projects that this year's extreme warmth is likely to occur every two years in the month of March by the year 2034.  The analysis' findings dovetail with other research that has predicted the mass die-off of coral reefs around the planet by the year 2050, as waters warm and exceed the tolerance level of many coral reef systems.  “We have loaded the odds against the survival of one of the world’s greatest natural wonders”  “These extreme temperatures will become commonplace by the 2030s putting a great strain on the ecosystems of the Great Barrier Reef,” said lead author Andrew King of the ARC centre of excellence for climate system science, in a statement.  “We have loaded the odds against the survival of one of the world’s greatest natural wonders,” he said.  Although the study has yet to be peer-reviewed, the methods used to detect the role of climate change in extreme events are becoming more firmly established in the climate science community.  We hope to submit a more comprehensive version of this analysis for peer-review soon, King told Mashable in an interview.  Such extreme event attribution studies have been used to detect the influence of human-caused global warming in other extreme temperature events.  For this study, researchers looked at temperature data and computer model simulations that included only natural factors that alter the climate, compared to simulations that include human emissions of greenhouse gases.  They found that the simulations that include greenhouse gases best fit the temperature data, and using statistical techniques they calculated the amount of the ocean warming that should be attributed to human-caused global warming, something known as fractional attributable risk.  In a blog post, the researchers said that they released the results prior to peer review because of the grave nature of their findings and importance of the Great Barrier Reef to all Australians.  “We are confident in the results because these kind of attribution studies are well established, but what we found demands urgent action if we are to preserve the reef,” King said.  “For this reason, we felt it was vital to get our findings out as quickly as possible.”  Coral reefs as the tripwire for dangerous interference with climate  The new analysis adds more evidence for those who argue that global warming may already be causing dangerous interference with the climate system.  That vague phrase from a 1992 U.N. climate treaty established what the nations of the world should work to avoid by cutting emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane.  Temperature projection showing that March 2016 temperatures become typical by 2034. Image: Geert Jan van Oldenborgh/KNMI in the Netherlands.  The Paris Agreement on climate change, which 172 countries signed on April 22, maintains that goal as its ultimate objective, without defining it.  This new analysis suggests we have already crossed into dangerous territory.  The damage to the reef is a very clear indicator of the harm our greenhouse gas emissions are doing to the planet, King said.  Hopefully this severe bleaching will help to trigger action so that we can curb our emissions.    A before and after image of the bleaching in American Samoa. The first image was taken in December 2014. The second image was taken in February 2015. Image: Catlin seaview survey  A strong El Niño climate event, combined with the impact of global warming and other factors, has prompted unusually warm ocean temperatures and the world's third-ever global coral bleaching event, which began in 2014 and is expected to continue until 2017.  The bleaching seen in the Coral Sea is part of this event.    Heidi Cullen, the chief scientist for Climate Central in New Jersey who leads a consortium of researchers who conduct extreme event attribution studies, told Mashable that this new analysis makes clear the heavy toll of burning fossil fuels.  It is the ultimate alarm bell that we need to drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions right away, she said.  Cullen was not involved in the new study.  The projection that much of the Great Barrier Reef could perish within the next few decades could turn out to be too pessimistic, since other research has shown that some species of corals are surprisingly resilient to the stress from changing ocean temperatures.                          In a press release on March 29, the Australian Coral Bleaching Task Force announced that the northern portions of the Great Barrier Reef are in the throes of the most intense coral bleaching event on record there.  The Task Force, comprised of 10 Australian research institutions, made its determination after completing aerial surveys of more than 500 coral reefs from Cairns north to Papua New Guinea.  “This has been the saddest research trip of my life,” says Prof. Terry Hughes, convener of the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, said in a press release.  “Almost without exception, every reef we flew across showed consistently high levels of bleaching, from the reef slope right up onto the top of the reef, Hughes said.  We flew for 4,000 kilometers in the most pristine parts of the Great Barrier Reef, and saw only four reefs that had no bleaching. The severity is much greater than in earlier bleaching events in 2002 or 1998.”  The ongoing global bleaching event is the longest-lasting one ever observed, and only the third ever seen. It has occurred during the warmest year on record, which occurred in 2015, and the two most unusually mild months on Earth, which took place in January and February, respectively.  “This has been the saddest research trip of my life”  It is due to record warm ocean temperatures around the world, partly driven by a strong El Niño event in the tropical Pacific Ocean.",partial
d53cf548,"Republican lawmaker: Rocks tumbling into ocean causing sea level rise Republican lawmaker: Rocks tumbling into ocean causing sea level rise  Originally published by E&E News  The Earth is not warming. The White Cliffs of Dover are tumbling into the sea and causing sea levels to rise. Global warming is helping grow the Antarctic ice sheet.  Those are some of the skeptical assertions echoed by Republicans on the U.S. House of Representatives Science, Space and Technology Committee yesterday. The lawmakers at times embraced research that questions mainstream climate science during a hearing on how technology can be used to address global warming.  A leading climate scientist testifying before the panel spent much of the two hours correcting misstatements.  The purpose of the hearing was to focus on how technology could be deployed for climate change adaptation. But the hearing frequently turned to the basics of climate science. Many of the questions by Republicans and Democrats alike were directed to Philip Duffy, president of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts and former senior adviser to the U.S. Global Change Research Program.  Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) said he was bothered that established climate science has not been questioned more by the committee, which has accused federal climate scientists of fraudulently manipulating climate data and subpoenaed their records.  I'm a little bit disturbed by, No. 1, over and over again, I hear, 'Don't ever talk about whether mankind is the main cause of the temperature changing and the climate changing,' he said. That's a little disturbing to hear constantly beaten into our heads in a Science Committee meeting, when basically we should all be open to different points of view.  Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), chairman of the committee, entered into the record an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that claimed sea levels are not rising because of climate change, a view that rejects thousands of scientific studies. The piece was written by Fred Singer, who is affiliated with the Heartland Institute in Chicago, Illinois, which promotes the rejection of mainstream climate science.  To solve climate change challenges, we first need to acknowledge the uncertainties that exist, Smith said in his opening remarks. Then we can have confidence that innovations and technology will enable us to mitigate any adverse consequences of climate change.  At one point, Smith showed a slide of two charts that he said demonstrated how the rate of sea-level rise does not equal the sharp spike in the consumption of fossil fuels. When Smith pointed out that rates of sea-level rise have only increased slightly compared with the rate of fossil fuel use, Duffy pointed out that his chart was from a single tide gauge station, near San Francisco, and that sea levels rise at different rates around the world. Smith did not show rising atmospheric CO 2 levels or temperatures, both of which have climbed steadily in recent decades as emissions have increased.  Every time you have that soil or rock or whatever it is that is deposited into the seas, that forces the sea levels to rise, because now you have less space in those oceans, because the bottom is moving up. Representative Mo Brooks (R–AL)  The rate of global sea-level rise has accelerated and is now four times faster than it was 100 years ago, Duffy told Smith in response to the charts.  Is this chart inaccurate, then? Smith asked.  It's accurate, but it doesn't represent what's happening globally; it represents what's happening in San Francisco, Duffy said.  Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) questioned Duffy on the factors that contribute to sea-level rise, pointing out that land subsidence plays a role, as well as human activity.  Brooks then said that erosion plays a significant role in sea-level rise, which is not an idea embraced by mainstream climate researchers. He said the California coastline and the White Cliffs of Dover tumble into the sea every year, and that contributes to sea-level rise. He also said that silt washing into the ocean from the world's major rivers, including the Mississippi, the Amazon and the Nile, is contributing to sea-level rise.  Every time you have that soil or rock or whatever it is that is deposited into the seas, that forces the sea levels to rise, because now you have less space in those oceans, because the bottom is moving up, Brooks said.  Duffy responded: I'm pretty sure that on human time scales, those are minuscule effects.  Brooks added that Antarctic ice is growing. That was true a few years ago, and scientists say it does not disprove the theory of global warming because different factors affect the Arctic and Antarctic rates of melting.  We have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage, Duffy said.  I'm sorry, but I don't know where you're getting your information, but the data I have seen suggests —  Brooks said.  Duffy answered: The National Snow and Ice Data Center and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  Well, I've got a NASA base in my district, and apparently, they're telling you one thing and me a different thing, Brooks said. But there are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet, particularly that above land, is increasing, not decreasing. Now, you could make a different argument if you want to talk about Greenland or the Arctic.  Earlier this year, NASA researchers determined that Antarctica's ice loss has accelerated in the last decade. More broadly, sea ice extent at both poles set a record low last year. Scientists are racing to better understand the changes occurring in Antarctica because much of its ice is land-based, meaning it could drive sea-level rise around the world as it melts.  Rep. Bill Posey (R-FL) said scientists said in the 1970s that the Earth was cooling, a popular talking point of climate skeptics and the subject of a fake Time magazine cover that has become a meme. Duffy corrected him and said that was essentially an outlier position at the time and that scientists long ago determined that humans were warming the planet.  Posey also asked how carbon dioxide could be captured in permafrost in the periods before humans existed. Duffy told him that it was from non-decayed organic matter. Human activity is now causing the Arctic to warm and thaw the ground, releasing the carbon into the atmosphere, Duffy said.  Posey then asked about theories related to warming being beneficial for habitats and to people.  What do you say to people who theorize that the Earth as it continues to warm is returning to its normal temperature? Posey asked.  Look, if you want to characterize a temperature above today's temperature as normal, you're free to do that, but that doesn't mean that's a planet we want to live on, Duffy said.  I don't want to get philosophical; I'm trying to stay on science here, Posey said.  I'm not getting philosophical; I'm getting extremely practical, Duffy said. I'm being extremely practical — if we let the planet warm 2 or 3 degrees, we will have tens of meters of sea-level rise, and the community where I live will essentially cease to exist.  Posey responded: I don't think anybody disputes that the Earth is getting warmer; I think what's not clear is the exact amount of who caused what, and getting to that is, I think, where we're trying to go with this committee.

a2580111,"Arctic’s strongest sea ice breaks up for first time on record The oldest and thickest sea ice in the Arctic has started to break up, opening waters north of Greenland that are normally frozen, even in summer.  This phenomenon – which has never been recorded before – has occurred twice this year due to warm winds and a climate-change driven heatwave in the northern hemisphere.  One meteorologist described the loss of ice as “scary”. Others said it could force scientists to revise their theories about which part of the Arctic will withstand warming the longest.  The sea off the north coast of Greenland is normally so frozen that it was referred to, until recently, as “the last ice area” because it was assumed that this would be the final northern holdout against the melting effects of a hotter planet.  But abnormal temperature spikes in February and earlier this month have left it vulnerable to winds, which have pushed the ice further away from the coast than at any time since satellite records began in the 1970s.  “Almost all of the ice to the north of Greenland is quite shattered and broken up and therefore more mobile,” said Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute. “Open water off the north coast of Greenland is unusual. This area has often been called ‘the last ice area’ as it has been suggested that the last perennial sea ice in the Arctic will occur here. The events of the last week suggest that, actually, the last ice area may be further west.”  Ice to the north of Greenland is usually particularly compacted due to the Transpolar Drift Stream, one of two major weather patterns that push ice from Siberia across the Arctic to the coastline, where it packs.  Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, said: “The ice there has nowhere else to go so it piles up. On average, it’s over four metres thick and can be piled up into ridges 20 metres thick or more. This thick, compacted ice is generally not easily moved around.  “However, that was not the case this past winter (in February and March) and now. The ice is being pushed away from the coast by the winds.”  Q&A How is climate change affecting the Arctic? Show The world may have warmed by about 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at about twice the rate of the rest of the world. In places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqiaġvik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. In the summer of 2019, an Arctic heatwave had parts of Greenland reach temperatures 40C hotter than normal. The Arctic is dominated by sea ice, unlike the Antarctic, which is essentially a huge land-based ice sheet. As the ocean and atmosphere warm, sea ice is shrinking in extent, at about 13% a decade since 1979, according to Nasa. The bright white surface of ice, known as albedo, is giving way to the dark ocean, meaning that sunlight is being absorbed rather than reflected, amplifying the warming effect. These rapid and unprecedented changes are transforming the Arctic and threatening traditional ways of life, according to US government scientists in a 2019 report card. The sea ice is younger, thinner, more fragile and less extensive, making hunting on the ice harder and more perilous. The marine ecosystem is shifting as warmer water forces fish species to retreat to more northern waters. What is a significant challenge to communities in the Arctic, is a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will become even simpler once the Arctic is ice-free in summertimes, forecast as soon as the 2040s.  Ice is easier to blow around as a result of a warming trend, which has accelerated over the past 15 years. “The thinning is reaching even the coldest part of the Arctic with the thickest ice. So it’s a pretty dramatic indication of the transformation of the Arctic sea ice and Arctic climate.”  “Scary,” wrote Thomas Lavergne, a scientist at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, in a retweet of a satellite-gif of the blue water penetrating white ice and exposing hundreds of miles of the Greenland coastline.  So the open water / low concentration patch North for Greenland is still there (and slowly moving westward). Nice and scary. From https://t.co/jPx1JmNayA https://t.co/hGstLYafcW — Thomas Lavergne (@lavergnetho) August 13, 2018  He said this would flush chunks of thicker ice out through the Fram or Nares Straits into warmer southern waters.  “I cannot tell how long this open water patch will remain open, but even if it closes in few days from now, the harm will be done: the thick old sea ice will have been pushed away from the coast, to an area where it will melt more easily,” he added.  This year’s openings are driven more by wind than melting but they have occurred during two temperature spikes. In February, the Kap Morris Jesup weather station in the region is usually below -20C, but earlier this year there were 10 days above freezing and warm winds, which unlocked the ice from the coast.  Arctic sea ice extent for 15 August 2018 was 5.7m sq km (2.2m sq miles). The orange line shows the 1981 to 2010 average extent for that day. Photograph: NSIDC  Last week, the crack opened again after Kap Morris Jesup briefly registered a record high of 17C and strong southerly winds picked up to 11 knots. Experts predict that coastal seas will freeze again but probably later than normal.  “I think that solar heating of the water column will increase during this opening and this will delay freeze-up and ice formation,” said Rasmus Tage Tonboe, a sea ice expert at the the Danish Meteorological Institute.  The latest readings by the Norwegian Ice Service show that Arctic ice cover in the Svalbard area this week is 40% below the average for this time of year since 1981. In the past month, at least 14 days in the past month have hit record lows in this region. Although thinner ice elsewhere in the Arctic means this is unlikely to be a record low year overall, they are in line with predictions that there will be no summer ice in the Arctic Ocean at some point between 2030 and 2050.  Keld Qvistgaard, the ice service coordinator in Denmark, said this was not the first time a gap had appeared between the shore and the main ice pack but the one formed from 1 to 5 August was different in its extent. “This event is a pretty big one going all the way to west of Kap Morris Jesup. This is unusual,” he said.  As well as reducing ice cover, the ocean intrusion raises concerns of feedbacks, which could tip the Earth towards a hothouse state.  Freakish Arctic temperatures have alarmed climate scientists since the beginning of the year. During the sunless winter, a heatwave raised concerns that the polar vortex may be eroding.  This includes the Gulf Stream, which is at its weakest level in 1,600 years due to melting Greenland ice and ocean warming. With lower circulation of water and air, weather systems tend to linger longer.  A dormant hot front has been blamed for record temperatures in Lapland and forest fires in Siberia, much of Scandinavia and elsewhere in the Arctic circle.",truth

Although the extent of the summer sea ice after 2006 dropped abruptly to levels not expected until 2050, the predicted 67-per-cent decline in polar bear numbers simply didn’t happen. Rather, global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved. The polar bear’s resilience should have meant the end of its use as a cherished icon of global warming doom, but it didn’t. The alarmism is not going away without a struggle. Part of this struggle involves a scientific clash about transparency in polar bear science. My close examination of recent research has revealed that serious inconsistencies exist within the polar bear literature and between that literature and public statements made by some researchers. For example, Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart, depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet. But that fact, documented in more than a dozen scientific papers, is not discussed today as part of polar bear ecology. In these days of politicized science, neither Stirling nor his colleagues mention in public the devastating effects of thick spring ice in the Beaufort Sea; instead, they imply in recent papers that the starving bears they witnessed are victims of reduced summer sea ice, which they argued depleted the bears’ prey. There are also strong indications that thick spring-ice conditions happened again in 2014–16, with the impacts on polar bears being similarly portrayed as effects of global warming.

Article content The polar bear's resilience should have meant the end of its use as an icon of global warming doom One reason that the 2007 predictions of future polar bear survival were so far off base is that the model developed by American biologist Steven Amstrup (now at Polar Bears International, an NGO) assumed any polar bear population decline would be caused by less summer ice, despite the Beaufort Sea experience. Moreover, Amstrup and fellow modelers were overly confident in their claim that summer ice was critical for the polar bear’s survival and they had little data on which to base their assumption that less summer ice would devastate the polar bears’ prey. Consequently, many scientists were surprised when other researchers subsequently found that ringed and bearded seals (the primary prey of polar bears) north of the Bering Strait especially thrived with a longer open-water season, which is particularly conducive to fishing: These seals do most of their feeding in summer. More food for seals in summer means more fat seal pups for polar bears to eat the following spring, a result that’s probably true throughout the Arctic. As long as polar bears have lots of baby seals to eat in spring, they get fat enough to survive even a longer-than-usual summer fast. And while it’s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s, there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice. Not all bears get enough to eat in the spring, of course. Starvation has always been the leading natural cause of death for polar bears, due to a number of factors including competition, injury, tooth decay and illness. Some cancers induce a muscle-wasting syndrome that leads to faster-than-usual weight loss. This is likely what happened to the emaciated Baffin Island bear captured on video in July 2017 and promoted by National Geographic late last year. The videographers claimed it showed what starvation due to sea-ice loss looked like — an implausible conclusion given the time of year, the isolated nature of the incident, and the fact that sea ice that year was no more reduced than previously.  Advertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.  Article content That starving-bear video may have convinced a few more gullible people that only hundreds of polar bears are left in the world. But it also motivated others to locate the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List report for 2015 that estimated global polar bear numbers at somewhere between 22,000-31,000, or about 26,000, up slightly from 20,000-25,000, or about 22,500, in 2005. Newer counts not included in the 2015 assessment potentially add another 2,500 or so to the total. This increase may not be statistically significant, but it is decidedly not the 67-per-cent decline that was predicted given the ice conditions that prevailed. The failure of the 2007 polar bear survival model is a simple fact that explodes the myth that polar bears are on their way to extinction. Although starving-bear videos and scientifically insignificant research papers still make the news, they don’t alter the facts: Polar bears are thriving, making them phony icons, and false idols, for global warming alarmists.

bae4220d,"Planet has only until 2030 to stem catastrophic climate change, experts warn (CNN) Governments around the world must take rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society to avoid disastrous levels of global warming , says a stark new report from the global scientific authority on climate change .  The report issued Monday by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), says the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030, precipitating the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.  The date, which falls well within the lifetime of many people alive today, is based on current levels of greenhouse gas emissions.  The planet is already two-thirds of the way there, with global temperatures having warmed about 1 degree C . Avoiding going even higher will require significant action in the next few years.  This is concerning because we know there are so many more problems if we exceed 1.5 degrees C global warming, including more heatwaves and hot summers, greater sea level rise, and, for many parts of the world, worse droughts and rainfall extremes, Andrew King, a lecturer in climate science at the University of Melbourne, said in a statement.  Global net emissions of carbon dioxide would need to fall by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero around 2050 in order to keep the warming around 1.5 degrees C.  Lowering emissions to this degree, while technically possible, would require widespread changes in energy, industry, buildings, transportation and cities, the report says.  The window on keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C is closing rapidly and the current emissions pledges made by signatories to the Paris Agreement do not add up to us achieving that goal, added King.  Sea ice is seen from NASA's Operation IceBridge research aircraft off the northwest coast of Greenland. Scientists say the Arctic has been one of the regions hardest hit by climate change.  Consequences of past inaction  The report makes it clear that climate change is already happening -- and what comes next could be even worse, unless urgent international political action is taken.  One of the key messages that comes out very strongly from this report is that we are already seeing the consequences of 1 degree C of global warming through more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, among other changes, said Panmao Zhai, co-chair of IPCC Working Group I.  Even if warming is kept at or just below 1.5 degrees C, the impacts will be widespread and significant.  Temperatures during summer heatwaves, such as those just experienced across Europe this summer, can be expected to increase by 3 degrees C says the report.  Coral reefs will also be drastically affected, with between 70 and 90% expected to die off, including Australia's Great Barrier Reef.  Countries in the southern hemisphere will be among the worse off, the report said, projected to experience the largest impacts on economic growth due to climate change should global warming increase.  The report underlines how even the smallest increase in the base target would worsen the impact of recent natural disasters.  Every extra bit of warming matters, especially since warming of 1.5 degrees C or higher increases the risk associated with long-lasting or irreversible changes, such as the loss of some ecosystems, said Hans-Otto Pörtner, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group II.  The report cites specific examples of how impacts of global warming would be lessened with the 1.5 degrees C increase, compared to the 2 degrees C increase:  Global sea levels would rise 10 cm lower by 2100.  The likelihood of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century, instead of at least once per decade.  Coral reefs would decline by 70% to 90% instead of being almost completely wiped out.  This chart from the IPCC shows how global temperatures would respond to a sudden and drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Even with immediate action, global temps will still overshoot the goal, but could reduce back to the target over time.  'Possible with the laws of chemistry and physics'  Monday's report is three years in the making and is a direct result of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement . In the Paris accord, 197 countries agreed to the goal of holding global temperatures well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees C.  The United States was initially in the agreement, but President Donald Trump pulled the country out a year and half later, claiming it was unfair to the country.  To limit global warming to 1.5 degree C is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics, said Jim Skea, co-chair of IPCC Working Group III. But doing so would require unprecedented changes.  International cooperation is absolutely imperative to limit emissions and therefore global warming and its impacts, as well as coordinating effective and widespread adaptation and mitigation, said Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a fellow at the Climate Change Research Center at the University of New South Wales. The next few years will be critical in the evolution of these efforts.  One key issue will be negative emissions, large scale carbon-scrubbing technologies that can reduce the amount in the atmosphere and act to counter continued pollution.  According to the report, there are two main ways of removing carbon from the atmosphere: increasing natural processes that already do this, and experimental carbon storage or removal technologies.  However, all methods are at different stages of development and some are more conceptual than others, as they have not been tested at scale, the report warned.  They will also require considerable political engagement globally, as will reducing the amount of carbon being emitted. Despite the report's dire warnings, there is no indication such cooperation will be doable, particularly given the Trump administration's stance on this issue.  Today the world's leading scientific experts collectively reinforced what mother nature has made clear -- that we need to undergo an urgent and rapid transformation to a global clean energy economy, former US Vice President Al Gore said.  Unfortunately, the Trump administration has become a rogue outlier in its shortsighted attempt to prop up the dirty fossil fuel industries of the past. The administration is in direct conflict with American businesses, states, cities and citizens leading the transformation.",truth
65ebf51e,"The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere just hit its highest level in 800,000 years, and scientists predict deadly consequences The average concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere topped 411 parts per million in May.  In April — the previous month — the concentration hit 410 ppm for the first time in recorded history.  These are the highest CO2 levels in the 800,000 years for which we have good data.  This is expected to have a catastrophic effect on human health and the planet.  We have a pretty good idea of what Earth's atmosphere has looked like for the past 800,000 years.  Humans like us — Homo sapiens — evolved about 200,000 years ago, but ice-core records reveal intricate details of our planet's history from long before humans existed. By drilling more than 3 kilometers deep into the ice sheets over Greenland and Antarctica, scientists can see how temperature and atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels have changed.  From that record, we know the atmosphere and the air that we breathe has never had as much carbon dioxide in it as it does today.  For the first time in recorded history, the average monthly level of CO2 in the atmosphere exceeded 410 parts per million in April, according to observations at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. In May, that number climbed above 411 ppm, according to researchers from Scripps Institute of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The record is not a coincidence — humans have rapidly transformed the air we breathe by pumping CO2 into it over the past two centuries. In recent years, we've pushed those gas levels into uncharted territory.  That change has inevitable and scary consequences. Research indicates that if unchecked, increased CO2 levels could cause pollution-related deaths to increase by tens of thousands, and lead to the slowing of human cognition (especially when you take into account the fact that CO2 levels tend to be higher indoors in cities). Carbon dioxide also contributes to warming that causes sea-level rise, searing heat waves, and superstorms.  As a scientist, what concerns me the most is what this continued rise actually means: that we are continuing full speed ahead with an unprecedented experiment with our planet, the only home we have, Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist, said on Twitter.  Vast glaciers in West Antarctica seem to be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may push up sea levels for centuries. NASA  Breathing the air of a new world  For the 800,000 years for which we have records, average global CO2 levels fluctuated between about 170 ppm and 280 ppm. Once humans started to burn fossil fuels in the industrial era, things changed rapidly.  Only in the industrial era has the number risen above 300 ppm. The concentration first crept above 400 ppm in 2013, and it continues to climb.  There's a debate among scientists about the last time CO2 levels were this high. It might have been during the Pliocene era, 2 million to 4.6 million years ago, when sea levels were 60 to 80 feet higher than today. Or it may have been in the Miocene, 10 million to 14 million years ago, when seas were more than 100 feet higher than now.  In our 800,000-year record, it took about 1,000 years for CO2 levels to increase by 35 ppm. We're currently averaging an increase of more than 2 ppm a year, meaning we could hit an average of 500 ppm within the next 45 years.  CO2 doesn't directly harm human health at these concentrations. But because it traps heat on the planet that then cranks up the global thermostat, it can have a very significant effect on health.  Global temperature tracks very closely to atmospheric levels of CO2. The potential effects of higher average temperatures include tens of thousands of deaths from heat waves, more extreme weather events, and the spread of diseases carried by ticks and mosquitoes — something we're already seeing. (There's a full list of possible ways climate change will affect human health on an archived Environmental Protection Agency page.)  Global annual temperature and CO2 levels, 1959 to 2016  Higher levels of CO2 and the warming they cause also exacerbate ozone pollution. One 2008 study found that for every degree Celsius the temperature rises because of CO2 levels, ozone pollution can be expected to kill an additional 22,000 people via respiratory illness, asthma, and emphysema.  Humans have never had to breathe air that's this polluted. Increased air pollution has been shown to cause lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and higher rates of allergies and asthma. A recent study found that 9 million people died prematurely from pollution-related diseases in 2015, accounting for 16% of all deaths worldwide.  Other research has raised even more concerns. The average CO2 level doesn't represent the air most of us breathe. Cities tend to have far more CO2 than average — and those levels rise even higher indoors. Some research indicates that it may have a negative effect on human cognition and decision-making.  For these reasons, President Barack Obama's EPA ruled in 2009 that CO2 was a pollutant that needed to be regulated under the Clean Air Act. But the Trump administration is reevaluating that ruling.  Pedestrians crossing a road on a smoggy day in Nanjing, China. Thomson Reuters  Drowning in CO2  The human-health effects of CO2 increases are just one part of the bigger story here.  The change we've seen in CO2 levels recently has been much more rapid than the historical trends. Some experts think we're on track to hit 550 ppm by the end of the century, which could cause average global temperatures to rise by 6 degrees Celsius. For context, the increase in superstorms, rising sea levels, and spreading tick-borne disease that we're already seeing comes after a 0.9-degree rise.  Data from Parrenin et al., 2013; Snyder et al., 2016; Bereiter et al., 2015. Ben Henley and Nerilie Abram/The Conversation  Projections of sea-level rise will also get more extreme as CO2 levels continue to climb.  Right now, carbon-dioxide emissions are still rising. The goal set in the Paris agreement on climate change is to limit the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius or less. But as a recent feature in the journal Nature revealed, we're on track for more than 3 degrees of warming.  The latest measurements show that if we want to avoid that dangerous scenario, we need to make dramatic changes very quickly.  This story was updated on June 12 to include the newly released data on CO2 levels hitting a new record in May and to clarify the means through which higher levels of CO2 affect human health.",partial

He also helped convene major academic panels to survey the evidence and communicate the near-unanimous scientific consensus on this topic to policymakers. For his efforts, Pielke was subjected to a vicious, well-funded smear campaign backed by, among others, the Obama White House and leading Democratic congressmen, culminating in his decision in 2015 to quit the field.

In 2013 Pielke testified to the United States Congress and relayed the IPCC findings. Shortly thereafter, Obama’s science advisor John Holdren accused him of misleading Congress and launched a lengthy but ill-informed attack on Pielke, which prompted congressional Democrats to open an investigation into Pielke’s sources of funding (which quickly fizzled amid benign conclusions). Meanwhile heavily funded left-wing groups succeeded in getting him fired from a popular internet news platform. In 2015 Pielke quit the climate field. So where did the science end up? In the second half of his talk, Pielke reviews the science as found in the most recent (2013) IPCC Assessment Report, the 2018 U.S. National Climate Assessment, and the most up-to-date scientific data and literature. Nothing substantial has changed. Globally there’s no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes and floods. Some regions experience more, some less and some no trend. Limitations of data and inconsistencies in patterns prevent confident claims about global trends one way or another. There’s no trend in U.S. hurricane landfall frequency or intensity. If anything, the past 50 years has been relatively quiet. There’s no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the U.S. Nor is there evidence of an increase in floods globally. Since 1965, more parts of the U.S. have seen a decrease in flooding than have seen an increase. And from 1940 to today, flood damage as a percentage of GDP has fallen to less than 0.05 per cent per year from about 0.2 per cent.

There’s no trend in U.S. tornado damage (in fact, 2012 to 2017 was below average). There’s no trend in global droughts. Cold snaps in the U.S. are down but, unexpectedly, so are heatwaves. The bottom line is there’s no solid connection between climate change and many major indicators of extreme weather that politicians keep talking about, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, rainfall and floods, despite Trudeau’s claims to the contrary. The continual claim of such links is misinformation employed for political and rhetorical purposes. Powerful people get away with it because so few people know what the numbers show. Many scientists who know better remain silent. And the few who push back against the propaganda, such as Roger Pielke Jr., find themselves on the receiving end of abuse and career-threatening attacks, even though they have all the science in their corner. Something has gotten scary and extreme, but it isn’t the weather. • Ross McKitrick is a professor of economics at the University of Guelph and senior fellow of the Fraser Institute.

2bbc1c1a,"Arctic methane deposits 'starting to release', scientists say Scientists say they have found evidence that frozen methane deposits in the Arctic Ocean have started to be released over a large area of the continental slope off the East Siberian coast, the Guardian can reveal.  High levels of the potent greenhouse gas have been detected down to a depth of 350 metres in the Laptev Sea near Russia, prompting concern among researchers that the discovery could have “serious climate consequences”.  The slope sediments in the Arctic contain a huge quantity of frozen methane and other gases – known as hydrates. Methane has a warming effect 80 times stronger than carbon dioxide over 20 years. The United States Geological Survey has previously listed Arctic hydrate destabilisation as one of four most serious scenarios for abrupt climate change.  The international team onboard the Russian research ship R/V Akademik Keldysh said most of the bubbles were currently dissolving in the water but methane levels at the surface were four to eight times what would normally be expected and this was venting into the atmosphere.  “At this moment, there is unlikely to be any major impact on global warming, but the point is that this process has now been triggered. This East Siberian slope methane hydrate system has been perturbed and the process will be ongoing,” said the Swedish scientist Örjan Gustafsson, of Stockholm University, in a satellite call from the vessel.  Quick Guide Methane and the Arctic Show Why are methane hydrates considered 'sleeping giants' for the climate? Scientists estimate 1,400 gigatonnes of carbon are locked up in subsea hydrates (frozen methane and other gases) under Arctic submarine permafrost, some of which could be vulnerable to global heating. If large volumes were released, this could rapidly destabilise the climate because methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a warming effect 80 times stronger than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Such concerns led the United States Geological Survey to list Arctic hydrate destabilisation as one of four most serious scenarios for abrupt climate change. This possibility – sometimes referred to as the 'clathrate gun hypothesis' – has been the basis for doomsday scenarios of runaway warming that tips the Earth towards a hothouse state. However, several studies suggest such fears are exaggerated.    That sounds scary. When could it happen? There are many uncertainties: at what temperature will hydrates destabilise and, if they do, how fast will it happen; and will the gas bubbles reach the surface and be released into the atmosphere or simply dissolve in the oceans? These and other questions are now the subject of intense research on the shelf and slopes of the Laptev Sea and other areas of the Arctic.    The scientists – who are part of a multi-year International Shelf Study Expedition – stressed their findings were preliminary. Methane seeps detected in the past were found to be historic, but the expedition believes these are new based on an earlier study showing movement of the subsea permafrost between the early 1980s and 2015. The scale of methane releases will not be confirmed until they return, analyse the data and have their studies published in a peer-reviewed journal.  But the discovery of potentially destabilised slope frozen methane raises concerns about the potential impact on the speed of global heating.  The Arctic is considered ground zero in the debate about the vulnerability of frozen methane deposits – which have been called the “sleeping giants of the carbon cycle” - in the ocean, and if releases were to exceed a tipping point it could increase the speed of global heating.  With the Arctic temperature now rising more than twice as fast as the global average, the question of when – or even whether – they will be released into the atmosphere has been a matter of considerable uncertainty in climate computer models.  The 60-member team on the Akademik Keldysh believe they are the first to observationally confirm the methane release is already under way across a wide area of the slope about 600km offshore.  Scientists at work on the test cruise Electra 1, prior to the Akademik Keldysh expedition. Photograph: ISSS2020  At six monitoring points over a slope area 150km in length and 10km wide, they saw clouds of bubbles released from sediment.  At one location on the Laptev Sea slope at a depth of about 300 metres they found methane concentrations of up to 1,600 nanomoles per litre, which is 400 times higher than would be expected if the sea and the atmosphere were in equilibrium.  Igor Semiletov, of the Russian Academy of Sciences, who is the chief scientist onboard, said the discharges were “significantly larger” than anything found before. “The discovery of actively releasing shelf slope hydrates is very important and unknown until now,” he said. “This is a new page. Potentially they can have serious climate consequences, but we need more study before we can confirm that.”  The most likely cause of the instability is an intrusion of warm Atlantic currents into the east Arctic. This “Atlantification” is driven by human-induced climate disruption.  The latest discovery potentially marks the third source of methane emissions from the region. Semiletov, who has been studying this area for two decades, has previously reported the gas is being released from the shelf of the Arctic – the biggest of any sea.  For the second year in a row, his team have found crater-like pockmarks in the shallower parts of the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea that are discharging bubble jets of methane, which is reaching the sea surface at levels tens to hundreds of times higher than normal. This is similar to the craters and sinkholes reported from inland Siberian tundra earlier this autumn.  Temperatures in Siberia were 5C higher than average from January to June this year, an anomaly that was made at least 600 times more likely by human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide and methane. Last winter’s sea ice melted unusually early. This winter’s freeze has yet to begin, already a later start than at any time on record.",partial
23ff9e71,"Avoiding meat and dairy is ‘single biggest way’ to reduce your impact on Earth Avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet, according to the scientists behind the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet.  The new research shows that without meat and dairy consumption, global farmland use could be reduced by more than 75% – an area equivalent to the US, China, European Union and Australia combined – and still feed the world. Loss of wild areas to agriculture is the leading cause of the current mass extinction of wildlife.  The new analysis shows that while meat and dairy provide just 18% of calories and 37% of protein, it uses the vast majority – 83% – of farmland and produces 60% of agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions. Other recent research shows 86% of all land mammals are now livestock or humans. The scientists also found that even the very lowest impact meat and dairy products still cause much more environmental harm than the least sustainable vegetable and cereal growing.  The study, published in the journal Science, created a huge dataset based on almost 40,000 farms in 119 countries and covering 40 food products that represent 90% of all that is eaten. It assessed the full impact of these foods, from farm to fork, on land use, climate change emissions, freshwater use and water pollution (eutrophication) and air pollution (acidification).  “A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use,” said Joseph Poore, at the University of Oxford, UK, who led the research. “It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car,” he said, as these only cut greenhouse gas emissions.  “Agriculture is a sector that spans all the multitude of environmental problems,” he said. “Really it is animal products that are responsible for so much of this. Avoiding consumption of animal products delivers far better environmental benefits than trying to purchase sustainable meat and dairy.”  The analysis also revealed a huge variability between different ways of producing the same food. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land result in 12 times more greenhouse gases and use 50 times more land than those grazing rich natural pasture. But the comparison of beef with plant protein such as peas is stark, with even the lowest impact beef responsible for six times more greenhouse gases and 36 times more land.  The large variability in environmental impact from different farms does present an opportunity for reducing the harm, Poore said, without needing the global population to become vegan. If the most harmful half of meat and dairy production was replaced by plant-based food, this still delivers about two-thirds of the benefits of getting rid of all meat and dairy production.  Cutting the environmental impact of farming is not easy, Poore warned: “There are over 570m farms all of which need slightly different ways to reduce their impact. It is an [environmental] challenge like no other sector of the economy.” But he said at least $500bn is spent every year on agricultural subsidies, and probably much more: “There is a lot of money there to do something really good with.”  Labels that reveal the impact of products would be a good start, so consumers could choose the least damaging options, he said, but subsidies for sustainable and healthy foods and taxes on meat and dairy will probably also be necessary.  One surprise from the work was the large impact of freshwater fish farming, which provides two-thirds of such fish in Asia and 96% in Europe, and was thought to be relatively environmentally friendly. “You get all these fish depositing excreta and unconsumed feed down to the bottom of the pond, where there is barely any oxygen, making it the perfect environment for methane production,” a potent greenhouse gas, Poore said.  The research also found grass-fed beef, thought to be relatively low impact, was still responsible for much higher impacts than plant-based food. “Converting grass into [meat] is like converting coal to energy. It comes with an immense cost in emissions,” Poore said.  The new research has received strong praise from other food experts. Prof Gidon Eshel, at Bard College, US, said: “I was awestruck. It is really important, sound, ambitious, revealing and beautifully done.”  He said previous work on quantifying farming’s impacts, including his own, had taken a top-down approach using national level data, but the new work used a bottom-up approach, with farm-by-farm data. “It is very reassuring to see they yield essentially the same results. But the new work has very many important details that are profoundly revealing.”  Prof Tim Benton, at the University of Leeds, UK, said: “This is an immensely useful study. It brings together a huge amount of data and that makes its conclusions much more robust. The way we produce food, consume and waste food is unsustainable from a planetary perspective. Given the global obesity crisis, changing diets – eating less livestock produce and more vegetables and fruit – has the potential to make both us and the planet healthier.”  Dr Peter Alexander, at the University of Edinburgh, UK, was also impressed but noted: “There may be environmental benefits, eg for biodiversity, from sustainably managed grazing and increasing animal product consumption may improve nutrition for some of the poorest globally. My personal opinion is we should interpret these results not as the need to become vegan overnight, but rather to moderate our [meat] consumption.”  Poore said: “The reason I started this project was to understand if there were sustainable animal producers out there. But I have stopped consuming animal products over the last four years of this project. These impacts are not necessary to sustain our current way of life. The question is how much can we reduce them and the answer is a lot.”",partial
fb4fbda8,"Ted Cruz: Trump should withdraw from Paris climate pact Ted Cruz represents Texas in the United States Senate. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.  (CNN) Following a successful international tour and the G-7 Summit in Italy, President Trump has an opportunity to relieve our nation of the unfair and economically devastating requirements of the Paris Agreement, the United Nations climate treaty he pledged to rip up during the campaign.  And as soon as possible , President Trump should act on -- and keep -- his campaign promise.  The agreement, signed by the Obama administration last year, would commit the United States to drastically reducing its carbon emissions while allowing some countries to increase theirs. This, all while doing nothing to meaningfully decrease global temperatures.  According to a recent National Economic Research Associates Economic Consulting study, the Paris Agreement could obliterate $3 trillion of GDP, 6.5 million industrial sector jobs and $7,000 in per capita household income from the American economy by 2040. Meeting the 2025 emissions reduction target alone could subtract $250 billion from our GDP and eliminate 2.7 million jobs. The cement, iron and steel, and petroleum refining industries could see their production cut by 21% 19%, and 11% respectively.  Not only would these unfair standards reduce American job growth and wages and increase monthly utility costs for hardworking families, they would fundamentally disadvantage the United States in the global economy. The result: our economic output would lag while other countries continued to expand their GDPs.  The agreement's proponents market it as a panacea for addressing the impacts of climate change, but at its core, it is about increasing government control -- over the economy, the energy sector and nearly every aspect of our daily lives. It represents the exact misguided, top-down, government-knows-best approach that American voters resoundingly rejected in 2016.  We cannot pursue a path that puts American workers first if we cripple a fossil fuel energy sector that generates 82% of the energy consumed in the United States. The coal industry alone supplies almost one-third of America's electric power -- with an increasing amount of clean coal-burning technology becoming available.  America is poised to become a net energy exporter over the next decade. We should not abandon that progress at the cost of weakening our energy renaissance and crippling economic growth.  And let's not forget the massive utility cost increases the agreement would entail. The Clean Power Plan, a major component of fulfilling the agreement, would spike energy costs for working and middle-class Texans by 16% by 2030 , according to the Economic Reliability Council of Texas, the entity that operates the electric grid for much of our state.  We simply cannot afford an agreement that puts thousands of Americans out of work, increases their energy costs and devastates our core industries.  In return for crippling our economy, the Paris Agreement would do next to nothing to impact global temperatures. Under the EPA's own models, if all carbon emissions in America were basically eliminated, global temperatures would only decrease by less than two-tenths of a degree Celsius.  While the agreement would have a negligible impact on temperatures, America would be putting itself at a competitive disadvantage. That's because while the Obama administration irresponsibly committed America to immediate, real cuts in emissions, our global economic competitors would have no such handicap. In fact, Russia is permitted to increase its emissions approximately 50% and China and India have no meaningful cap on emissions until 2030.  This disparity among the countries' pledges inflicts real losses on our economy now while our rivals continue to grow, industrialize and diversify at their own pace with no implementation costs. In the meantime, the agreement would force American taxpayers to subsidize alternative energy at the expense of clean coal, nuclear power and natural gas -- energy resources that actually work for our economy and our environment.  The Paris Agreement would also handicap America in the global race for new sources of energy. Russia has committed financial and military assets to the Arctic to stake its claim to the region's vast deepwater mineral, oil and gas deposits. China is also exploring and trading for Arctic oil and gas. Meanwhile, American liquefied natural gas struggles with logistical costs that weaken its competitiveness.  By allowing our rivals to increase their cooperation and strategic leverage around the world -- pressuring our allies and partners, harming domestic job creators and materially reducing our prestige and influence in the process --- the agreement would damage America's national security as much as our economic security. The emission cuts that the US would have to make today, and the resultant costs for our own energy firms, would weaken our ability to battle our rivals on an equal footing in the drive for untapped energy sources.  Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook  Efforts to unwind some of the deal's more onerous regulations are welcomed, but that is not enough. Unless the US completely withdraws, the Paris Agreement will continue to cause sustained harm to our security and economy, and it keeps the door open for future administrations to use it as means to impose more costly and ineffective energy regulations.  We should not let a deal subject to the whims of future administrations or Congresses hang like a wet blanket over our economy -- driving up energy prices, devastating our industrial base and bolstering our rivals.  I hope President Trump will take the opportunity before him to fulfill the commitment he made and withdraw America from the Paris Agreement.",partial
caa34051,"Domino-effect of climate events could move Earth into a ‘hothouse’ state A domino-like cascade of melting ice, warming seas, shifting currents and dying forests could tilt the Earth into a “hothouse” state beyond which human efforts to reduce emissions will be increasingly futile, a group of leading climate scientists has warned.  This grim prospect is sketched out in a journal paper that considers the combined consequences of 10 climate change processes, including the release of methane trapped in Siberian permafrost and the impact of melting ice in Greenland on the Antarctic.  The authors of the essay, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, stress their analysis is not conclusive, but warn the Paris commitment to keep warming at 2C above pre-industrial levels may not be enough to “park” the planet’s climate at a stable temperature.  They warn that the hothouse trajectory “would almost certainly flood deltaic environments, increase the risk of damage from coastal storms, and eliminate coral reefs (and all of the benefits that they provide for societies) by the end of this century or earlier.”  Fifty years ago, this would be dismissed as alarmist, but now scientists have become really worried Johan Rockström, executive ​director, Stockholm Resilience Centre  “I do hope we are wrong, but as scientists we have a responsibility to explore whether this is real,” said Johan Rockström, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre. “We need to know now. It’s so urgent. This is one of the most existential questions in science.”  Rockström and his co-authors are among the world’s leading authorities on positive feedback loops, by which warming temperatures release new sources of greenhouse gases or destroy the Earth’s ability to absorb carbon or reflect heat.  Their new paper asks whether the planet’s temperature can stabilise at 2C or whether it will gravitate towards a more extreme state. The authors attempt to assess whether warming can be halted or whether it will tip towards a “hothouse” world that is 4C warmer than pre-industrial times and far less supportive of human life.  Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen, one of the authors, said the paper showed that climate action was not just a case of turning the knob on emissions, but of understanding how various factors interact at a global level.  “We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions,” she said. “This implies not only reducing emissions but much more.”  New feedback loops are still being discovered. A separate paper published in PNAS reveals that increased rainfall – a symptom of climate change in some regions - is making it harder for forest soils to trap greenhouse gases such as methane.    Previous studies have shown that weakening carbon sinks will add 0.25C, forest dieback will add 0.11C, permafrost thaw will add 0.9C and increased bacterial respiration will add 0.02C. The authors of the new paper also look at the loss of methane hydrates from the ocean floor and the reduction of snow and ice cover at the poles.  Rockström says there are huge gaps in data and knowledge about how one process might amplify another. Contrary to the Gaia theory, which suggests the Earth has a self-righting tendency, he says the feedbacks could push the planet to a more extreme state.  As an example, the authors say the loss of Greenland ice could disrupt the Gulf Stream ocean current, which would raise sea levels and accumulate heat in the Southern Ocean, which would in turn accelerate ice loss from the east Antarctic. Concerns about this possibility were heightened earlier this year by reports that the Gulf Stream was at its weakest level in 1,600 years.  Currently, global average temperatures are just over 1C above pre-industrial levels and rising at 0.17C per decade. The Paris climate agreement set actions to keep warming limited to 1.5C-2C by the end of the century, but the authors warn more drastic action may be necessary.  “The heatwave we now have in Europe is not something that was expected with just 1C of warming,” Rockström said. “Several positive feedback loops are already in operation, but they are still weak. We need studies to show when they might cause a runaway effect.  Another climate scientist – who was not involved in the paper – emphasised the document aimed to raise questions rather than prove a theory. “It’s rather selective, but not outlandish,” said Prof Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute. “Threshold and tipping points have been discussed previously, but to state that 2C is a threshold we can’t pull back from is new, I think. I’m not sure what ‘evidence’ there is for this – or indeed whether there can be until we experience it.”  Rockström said the question needed asking. “We could end up delivering the Paris agreement and keep to 2C of warming, but then face an ugly surprise if the system starts to slip away,” he said. “We don’t say this will definitely happen. We just list all the disruptive events and come up with plausible occurrences … 50 years ago, this would be dismissed as alarmist, but now scientists have become really worried.”  “In the context of the summer of 2018, this is definitely not a case of crying wolf, raising a false alarm: the wolves are now in sight,” said Dr Phil Williamson, a climate researcher at the University of East Anglia. “The authors argue that we need to be much more proactive in that regard, not just ending greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible, but also building resilience in the context of complex Earth system processes that we might not fully understand until it is too late.”",partial
e122d505,"95-Degree Days: How Extreme Heat Could Spread Across the World Extremely hot days, when temperatures soar to 95 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, can be miserable. Crops wilt in the fields. Electric grids strain to keep pace with demand. People are at greater risk of dying. And those hot temperatures are expected to be much more frequent in the coming decades.  Global warming under Paris pledges  Global warming under Paris pledges  Days per year above 95°F 5 50 100 200  The map above, based on a new analysis from the Climate Impact Lab, shows how 95-degree days (35 degrees Celsius) are expected to multiply this century if countries take moderate climate action. In this scenario, countries would take some measures, but not drastic ones, to curb emissions — roughly the trajectory of the current pledges under the Paris climate agreement.  The resulting global warming would still cause significant shifts for many cities. In Washington, from 1986 to 2005, an average of seven days each year had temperatures of at least 95 degrees. By the end of the century, the city can expect 29 of these extremely hot days per year, on average. (The likely range is 14 to 46 hot days per year.)  Phoenix is used to the heat, averaging 124 days per year with 95-degree weather. At the end of the century, that’s expected to increase to around 155 days — an extra month of extreme temperatures each year. Madrid would go from eight severely hot days per year to 43, Beijing from nine to 35.  The swings are even greater closer to the equator. New Delhi, India’s capital city, has historically averaged 105 days with temperatures of at least 95 degrees each year. That’s likely to rise to a range of 137 to 200 days per year.  Things could get worse if countries fail to take action  If the world’s nations took no action on global warming, and emissions continued to rise at the same pace they did in the first decade of this century — with total global warming of 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit or more by the end of the century — extremely hot days would become much more commonplace.  Global warming if no action is taken  Global warming if no action is taken  Days per year above 95°F 5 50 100 200  By 2100, Washington could swelter in 95-degree weather for fully one-fifth of the year — around 74 days, on average. Large swaths of Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa would experience these temperatures for most of the year.  This worst case for global warming now appears less likely as global coal use declines and nations slowly move toward cleaner energy.  How 95-degree days disrupt our everyday lives  In the United States, electricity use soars as temperatures rise and more households use air-conditioning more frequently. One recent study found that the United States’ electric grid would have to handle a 7.2 percent increase in peak demand this century under a moderate warming scenario.  As temperature increases: Electricity consumption spikes. And crop yields plunge. Change in monthly California electricity usage relative to a 65°F day, 1999 to 2009.

Roberts/University of Hawaii and Wolfram Schlenker/Columbia University. Via Tamma Carleton/ Science  The flip side is that air-conditioning can be an essential adaptation tactic. In countries without widespread cooling, heat deaths rise more sharply during the hottest days. One study estimated that heat deaths in India increase by 3.2 percent for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit above 68 (or every 1 degree Celsius above 20). Energy use in many countries may rise sharply as people struggle to adapt to a hotter climate.  Other scientists have found that corn and soybean yields in the United States plummet precipitously when temperatures rise above 84 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius), and that worker productivity declines sharply, particularly for outdoor jobs. And researchers are trying to understand how crime and conflict might rise as temperatures increase.  Ultimately, people will be better able to adapt if they have a better idea of what individual cities and regions can expect, said Trevor Houser, who co-directs the Climate Impact Lab. In the United States, some urban planners are already experimenting with techniques like adding green spaces or increasing the reflectivity of rooftops to cool down city centers during heat waves.  “Right now, when you start talking to people about higher temperatures, they tend to think, great, more beach days,” said Solomon Hsiang, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley who helps direct the lab. “What’s often less appreciated is just how much an extremely hot day can distort our lives in all sorts of ways we don’t often even think about.”",truth
4ebbbb28,"Climate scientists drive stake through heart of skeptics' argument Global warming skeptics sometimes say rising temperatures are just another naturally occurring shift in Earth’s climate, like the Medieval Warm Period of the years 800 to 1200 or the Little Ice Age, a period of cooling that spanned from roughly 1300 to 1850.  But a pair of studies published Wednesday provides stark evidence that the rise in global temperatures over the past 150 years has been far more rapid and widespread than any warming period in the past 2,000 years — a finding that undercuts claims that today’s global warming isn’t necessarily the result of human activity.  “The familiar maxim that the climate is always changing is certainly true,” Scott St. George, a physical geographer at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, said in a written commentary about the studies. “But even when we push our perspective to the earliest days of the Roman Empire, we cannot discern any event that is remotely equivalent — either in degree or extent — to the warming over the last few decades.”  Since the beginning of the 20th century, the global average temperature on Earth has risen by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. A consensus of climate scientists pins the increase primarily on the burning of fossil fuels, which spews carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the air. In the absence of concerted efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the United Nations says, the global average temperature could rise an additional 5.4 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.  One of the studies, published in the journal Nature, shows that the Little Ice Age and other natural fluctuations affected only limited regions of the planet at a time, making modern warming the first and only planetwide warm period in the past two millennia. The other study, published in Nature Geoscience, shows that the rate of modern warming has far outpaced changes that occurred before the rise of the industrial era.  For the research, a team led by Raphael Neukom, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bern’s Institute of Geography in Switzerland, analyzed 2,000 years' worth of climate data. In the absence of direct temperature information — thermometer measurements were scarce before the middle of the 19th century — the scientists looked at data on old trees’ growth rings, layers of glacier ice and the remnants of corals, whose layers have different chemical compositions depending on the temperature of seawater.  The Nature study mapped the temperature fluctuations across the planet, finding, for example, that the Little Ice Age didn’t affect the whole world at once. Temperatures bottomed out in the Pacific Ocean around 1500, the scientists found; Europe and North America didn’t fully chill out for another two centuries.  The same pattern was observed for the higher temperatures seen during the Medieval Warm Period. The researchers found that less than half of the planet felt the heat at once.  The research indicates that during the current period of warming, more than 98 percent of the Earth’s surface has experienced record high temperatures. The finding shows just how dramatically today’s global rise in temperatures differs from previous periods of temperature change, the scientists said.  “What we show is that these periods aren’t globally coherent as previously thought,” said Nathan Steiger, a climate scientist at Columbia University in New York City and a co-author of the Nature study. The current period of warming “stands in stark contrast” to today’s warming, he added, calling it “a globally coherent warm period that is very different from what we see in the past.”  For the Nature Geoscience study, the researchers charted global temperature averages over time, and then compared the data to a set of climate simulations to figure out what might have driven the changes. Neukom and his colleagues found that the fastest warming in the last two millennia occurred during the second half of the 20th century.  The researchers also found that the main cause of temperature fluctuations changed over time. Prior to 1850, fluctuations were mainly linked to volcanic eruptions, which cooled the planet by spewing sun-blocking ash into the stratosphere; after 1850, greenhouse gas emissions took the wheel.  “It’s exciting to see studies like this that combine rigorous statistics with huge databases to make clear conclusions about past climate change,” said Gabriela Serrato Marks, a graduate student in paleoclimatology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who wasn't involved in the new research.  Serrato Marks said the records the researchers used could be incomplete, adding that subsequent research could benefit from more robust data. “Future studies will be strengthened even more with data from the Southern Hemisphere and more high-resolution data,” she said.  Jennifer Hertzberg, a paleoclimatologist at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, who wasn’t involved in the research, called the study “very important” and praised its use of multiple statistical methods to reconstruct temperature change over time. She urged the public to take the results to heart.  “The global temperatures that we’re seeing now are higher than they have been in the last 2,000 years,” she said. “What we’re seeing now is uncharted territory. It’s time for everybody to wake up and make changes now.”  Want more stories about science?  Follow NBC News MACH on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram.",partial
acd7cfb8,"Huge reduction in meat-eating ‘essential’ to avoid climate breakdown Huge reductions in meat-eating are essential to avoid dangerous climate change, according to the most comprehensive analysis yet of the food system’s impact on the environment. In western countries, beef consumption needs to fall by 90% and be replaced by five times more beans and pulses.  The research also finds that enormous changes to farming are needed to avoid destroying the planet’s ability to feed the 10 billion people expected to be on the planet in a few decades.  Food production already causes great damage to the environment, via greenhouse gases from livestock, deforestation and water shortages from farming, and vast ocean dead zones from agricultural pollution. But without action, its impact will get far worse as the world population rises by 2.3 billion people by 2050 and global income triples, enabling more people to eat meat-rich western diets.  This trajectory would smash critical environmental limits beyond which humanity will struggle to live, the new research indicates. “It is pretty shocking,” said Marco Springmann at the University of Oxford, who led the research team. “We are really risking the sustainability of the whole system. If we are interested in people being able to farm and eat, then we better not do that.”  “Feeding a world population of 10 billion is possible, but only if we change the way we eat and the way we produce food,” said Prof Johan Rockström at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, who was part of the research team. “Greening the food sector or eating up our planet: this is what is on the menu today.”  The new study follows the publication of a landmark UN report on Monday in which the world’s leading scientists warned there are just a dozen years in which to keep global warming under 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods and extreme heat. The report said eating less meat and dairy was important but said current trends were in the opposite direction.  The new research, published in the journal Nature, is the most thorough to date and combined data from every country to assess the impact of food production on the global environment. It then looked at what could be done to stop the looming food crisis.  “There is no magic bullet,” said Springmann. “But dietary and technological change [on farms] are the two essential things, and hopefully they can be complemented by reduction in food loss and waste.” About a third of food produced today never reaches the table.  The researchers found a global shift to a “flexitarian” diet was needed to keep climate change even under 2C, let alone 1.5C. This flexitarian diet means the average world citizen needs to eat 75% less beef, 90% less pork and half the number of eggs, while tripling consumption of beans and pulses and quadrupling nuts and seeds. This would halve emissions from livestock and better management of manure would enable further cuts.  In rich nations, the dietary changes required are ever more stark. UK and US citizens need to cut beef by 90% and milk by 60% while increasing beans and pulses between four and six times. However, the millions of people in poor nations who are undernourished need to eat a little more meat and dairy.  Reducing meat consumption might be achieved by a mix of education, taxes, subsidies for plant-based foods and changes to school and workplace menus, the scientists said.  To halt deforestation, water shortages and pollution from overuse of fertiliser, profound changes in farming practices are needed. These include increasing crop yields in poorer nations, more universal water storage and far more careful use of fertilisers.  “I was surprised by the fact we need a combination of very ambitious options,” Springmann said. “We really need to push it to the edge of what is possible.”  All the diet and farming options are already being implemented in somewhere in the world, said Springmann. In the Netherlands and Israel, fertilisers and water are being better used, while big cuts in meat consumption are being seen among young people in some cities.  But a global change is needed, he said: “I think we can do it, but we really need much more proactive governments to provide the right framework. People can make a personal difference by changing their diet, but also by knocking on the doors of their politicians and saying we need better environmental regulations – that is also very important. Do not let politicians off the hook.”  Prof Tim Benton at the University of Leeds, who was not part of the research team, said: “Ultimately, we live on a finite planet, with finite resources. It is a fiction to imagine there is a technological solution allowing us to produce as much food as we might ever want, allowing us to overeat and throw food away.” He said the environmental burden of the current food system “undermines the ability of future generations to live on a stable and ecologically rich planet”.  Prof Peter Smith at the University of Aberdeen, who was also not part of the research team, said: “We know food choices are very personal, and that behaviour change can be difficult to encourage, but the evidence is now unequivocal – we need to change our diets if we are to have a sustainable future. The fact that it will also make us healthier makes it a no-brainer.”",truth
70c53cf5,"Heart-Wrenching Video Shows Starving Polar Bear on Iceless Land The text on the video above was edited on June 1, 2018 to make it clear that it is impossible to know why the polar bear pictured was starving. An earlier version of the video went too far in suggesting that climate change was responsible ( read more ). This story was updated on January 19, 2018 to reflect the more specific location of where the photographs were taken.  When photographer Paul Nicklen and filmmakers from conservation group Sea Legacy arrived on Somerset Island—near the larger Baffin Island—in the Canadian Arctic in late summer, they came across a heartbreaking sight: a starving polar bear on its deathbed.  Nicklen is no stranger to bears. From the time he was a child growing up in Canada's far north the biologist turned wildlife photographer has seen over 3,000 bears in the wild. But the emaciated polar bear, featured in videos Nicklen published to social media on December 5, was one of the most gut-wrenching sights he's ever seen.  We stood there crying—filming with tears rolling down our cheeks, he said.  Video shows the polar bear clinging to life, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. One of the bear's back legs drags behind it as it walks, likely due to muscle atrophy. Looking for food, the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers. It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground.  In the days since Nicklen posted the footage, he's been asked why he didn’t intervene.  Of course, that crossed my mind, said Nicklen. But it's not like I walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat.  And even if he did, said Nicklen, he only would have been prolonging the bear's misery. Plus, feeding wild polar bears is illegal in Canada.  The wildlife photographer says he filmed the bear's slow, beleaguered death because he didn't want it to die in vain.  When scientists say bears are going extinct, I want people to realize what it looks like. Bears are going to starve to death, said Nicklen. This is what a starving bear looks like.  The Climate Change Link?  By telling the story of one polar bear, Nicklen hopes to convey a larger message about how a warming climate has deadly consequences.  Polar bears have long been unwitting mascots for the effects of climate change. As animals that live only in Arctic regions, they're often the first to feel the impacts of warming temperatures and rising seas.  The large, half-ton bears find concentrations of seals on sea ice. During summer months, it's not uncommon for polar bears to go months without eating while they wait for Arctic ice to solidify.  In 2002, a World Wildlife Fund report predicted that climate change could eventually lead to polar bear endangerment or extinction. Even then, the report found that polar bears were moving from ice to land earlier and staying on land longer, unhealthily extending the bears' fasting season. By the end of summer, most bears studied by the World Wildlife Fund showed signs of starvation.  Fifteen years later, polar bears' icy hunting grounds are in even worse shape. The National Snow and Ice Data Center, which tracks sea ice cover annually, has regularly noted record lows in sea ice coverage—a decline that is expected to only get worse. (Read more about drastic predictions for dwindling sea ice.)  A study recently published in the journal Biosciences looked at how climate science is often falsely discredited. The study found climate deniers are able to downplay the threat of climate change by discrediting the threat facing polar bears.

00c29642,"Climate worst-case scenarios may not go far enough, cloud data shows Worst-case global heating scenarios may need to be revised upwards in light of a better understanding of the role of clouds, scientists have said.  Recent modelling data suggests the climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than previously believed, and experts said the projections had the potential to be “incredibly alarming”, though they stressed further research would be needed to validate the new numbers.  Modelling results from more than 20 institutions are being compiled for the sixth assessment by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is due to be released next year.  Compared with the last assessment in 2014, 25% of them show a sharp upward shift from 3C to 5C in climate sensitivity – the amount of warming projected from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide from the preindustrial level of 280 parts per million. This has shocked many veteran observers, because assumptions about climate sensitivity have been relatively unchanged since the 1980s.  “That is a very deep concern,” Johan Rockström, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said. “Climate sensitivity is the holy grail of climate science. It is the prime indicator of climate risk. For 40 years, it has been around 3C. Now, we are suddenly starting to see big climate models on the best supercomputers showing things could be worse than we thought.”  He said climate sensitivity above 5C would reduce the scope for human action to reduce the worst impacts of global heating. “We would have no more space for a soft landing of 1.5C [above preindustrial levels]. The best we could aim for is 2C,” he said.  Worst-case projections in excess of 5C have been generated by several of the world’s leading climate research bodies, including the UK Met Office’s Hadley Centre and the EU’s Community Earth System Model.  Timothy Palmer, a professor in climate physics at Oxford University and a member of the Met Office’s advisory board, said the high figure initially made scientists nervous. “It was way outside previous estimates. People asked whether there was a bug in the code,” he said. “But it boiled down to relatively small changes in the way clouds are represented in the models.”  The role of clouds is one of the most uncertain areas in climate science because they are hard to measure and, depending on altitude, droplet temperature and other factors, can play either a warming or a cooling role. For decades, this has been the focus of fierce academic disputes.  Previous IPCC reports tended to assume that clouds would have a neutral impact because the warming and cooling feedbacks would cancel each other out. But in the past year and a half, a body of evidence has been growing showing that the net effect will be warming. This is based on finer resolution computer models and advanced cloud microphysics.  “Clouds will determine humanity’s fate – whether climate is an existential threat or an inconvenience that we will learn to live with,” said Palmer. “Most recent models suggest clouds will make matters worse.”  In a recent paper in the journal Nature, Palmer explains how the new Hadley Centre model that produced the 5+C figure on climate sensitivity was tested by assessing its accuracy in forecasting short-term weather. This testing technique had exposed flaws in previous models, but in the latest case, the results reinforced the estimates. “The results are not reassuring – they support the estimates,” he wrote. He is calling for other models to be tested in a similar way.  “It’s really important. The message to the government and public is, you have to take this high climate sensitivity seriously. [We] must get emissions down as quickly as we can,” he said.  The IPCC is expected to include the 5+C climate sensitivity figure in its next report on the range of possible outcomes. Scientists caution that this is a work in progress and that doubts remain because such a high figure does not fit with historical records.  Catherine Senior, head of understanding climate change at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said more studies and more data were needed to fully understand the role of clouds and aerosols.  “This figure has the potential to be incredibly alarming if it is right,” she said. “But as a scientist, my first response is: why has the model done that? We are still in the stage of evaluating the processes driving the different response.”  While acknowledging the continued uncertainty, Rockström said climate models might still be underestimating the problem because they did not fully take into account tipping points in the biosphere.  “The more we learn, the more fragile the Earth system seems to be and the faster we need to move,” he said. “It gives even stronger argument to step out of this Covid-19 crisis and move full speed towards decarbonising the economy.”",partial
a73a57a1,"Delingpole: Study Disputes That Earth Is in a ‘Climate Emergency’ There is no “climate emergency”, according to a study for the Global Warming Policy Foundation by independent scientist Dr Indur Goklany.  Goklany concludes:  While climate may have changed for the warmer: • Most extreme weather phenomena have not become more extreme, more deadly, or more destructive • Empirical evidence directly contradicts claims that increased carbon dioxide has reduced human wellbeing. In fact, human wellbeing has never been higher • Whatever detrimental effects warming and higher carbon dioxide may have had on terrestrial species and ecosystems, they have been swamped by the contribution of fossil fuels to increased biological productivity. This has halted, and turned around, reductions in habitat loss  The report will make hugely depressing reading for all the prominent environmental activists — from the Pope and Doom Goblin Greta Thunberg to the Great Reset’s Klaus Schwab — who have been pushing the “climate emergency” narrative. It is an article of faith for the globalist elite and their useful idiots in the media, in politics, in business, and the entertainment that the world is on course for climate disaster which only radical and costly international action can prevent.  But Goklany’s report — Impacts of Climate Change: Perception & Reality — claims there is little if any evidence to support the scare narrative.  At the end, Goklany provides a table, setting out all the scaremongering claims made by environmental groups — and then comparing them with observed reality. Only one of the claims stands up, according to the study — weather has been getting slightly warmer:  More hot days and fewer cold days — Yes Cyclones/hurricanes more intense or frequent — No Tornadoes increase and become more intense — No Floods more frequent and more intense — No Droughts more frequent and intense — No Area burned by wildfire increasing — No (area peaked in mid-19th century) Cereal yields decreasing — No (they have tripled since 1961) Food supplies per capita decreasing — No (increased 31 per cent since 1961) Land area and beaches shrinking, coral islands submerged — No. (Marginal expansion)  None of the doom-mongering claims made about a decline in human welfare stands up, either, according to the study.  Access to cleaner water has increased; mortality from ‘Extreme Weather Events’ has declined by 99 per cent since the 1920s; fewer people are dying from heat; death rates from climate-sensitive diseases like malaria and diarrhoea have decreased (since 1900 malaria death rates have declined 96 per cent); hunger rates have declined; poverty has declined (GDP per capita has quadrupled since 1950 even as CO2 levels have sextupled); life expectancy has more than doubled since the start of industrialisation; health adjusted life expectancy has increased; global inequality has decreased in terms of incomes, life expectancies and access to modern-day amenities; the earth is green and more productive; habitat lost to agriculture has peaked due to fossil fuel dependent technologies.  It will be hard for green activists to dismiss Goklany as a “denier”. His credentials as a climate expert are impeccable. He was a member of the U.S. delegation that established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and helped develop its First Assessment Report. He subsequently served as a U.S. delegate to the IPCC, and as an IPCC reviewer.  Goklany says:  Almost everywhere you look, climate change is having only small, and often benign, impacts. The impact of extreme weather events ― hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and droughts ― are, if anything, declining. Economic damages have declined as a fraction of global GDP. Death rates from such events have declined by 99% since the 1920s. Climate-related disease has collapsed. And more people die from cold than warm temperatures.  Even sea-level rise — predicted to be the most damaging impact of global warming — seems to be much less of a problem than thought, according to to the study’s findings.  Goklany says:  A recent study showed that the Earth has actually gained more land in coastal areas in the last 30 years than it has lost through sea-level rise. We now know for sure that coral atolls aren’t disappearing and even Bangladesh is gaining more land through siltation than it is losing through rising seas.  In his report, Goklany destroys many of the green movement’s shibboleths, including the notion that fossil fuels are bad for the planet. Not only, he suggests, has their CO2 contributed to “global greening” — “contrary to prevailing wisdom, tree cover globally has increased by over 2 million km2 between 1982 and 2016, an increase of 7 per cent” — but they provide the fertilisers and pesticides which simultaneously feed the planet and reduce the amount of land required for agriculture:",partial
648e6bc4,"WHO: United States Among Least Polluting Nations on the Planet Despite recent attempts to paint the United States as a major global polluter, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. is among the cleanest nations on the planet.  In the most recent WHO report on air pollution, the United States was listed as one of the countries with the cleanest air in the world, significantly cleaner in fact than the air in Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the UK, Japan, Austria and France.  While France and other G7 countries lamented the U.S. exit from the Paris climate accord, America’s air is already cleaner than that of any other country in the G7, except Canada with its scant population.  Following standard practice, the WHO measures air pollution by the mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter. These are the particles that cause diseases of all sorts and are responsible for most deaths by air pollution.  According to the WHO, exposure to particulate matter increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke and lung cancer.  The report, which analyzed the “annual median concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) for both urban population and rural and urban population” found that the United States was one of the most pollution-free nations in the world.  The annual mean concentrations of particulate matter in the air range from less than 10 to over 100 µg/m3, the report states. At the very low end of the spectrum, the United States has a concentration of just 8, while China has a concentration more than seven times higher at 59, India at 66, Egypt at 101 and Saudi Arabia with the worst air pollution at 127.  “The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter is a common measure of air pollution,” the WHO states.  The WHO report is corroborated by a series of other such studies on air and water pollution.  In a recent list of the 25 cleanest cities in the world, the only country to boast three cities among the cleanest on the planet was the United States of America, with Chicago coming in second place, Honolulu coming in fourth, and Portland, OR, coming in sixteenth. Unsurprisingly, no cities from China, Russia or India made the list at all.  Similarly, another list of the 15 most polluted cities in the world featured three cities from China, three cities from Saudi Arabia, and a whopping seven cities from India. No U.S. city made the list.  A third list, ranking the ten cleanest and ten most polluted cities in the world, placed two U.S. cities on the list of cleanest cities on the planet. The list of the most polluted cities in the world was led by two cities from China followed by two more cities from India. Two Russian cities also made the list. Again, no U.S. cities were found here.  With such relatively clean air throughout America, how can even reputable news agencies like Reuters continue spreading the well-worn lie that the United States is one of the “biggest polluters” in the world?  Rather than follow the time-tested practice used by the World Health Organization, which measures levels of disease-causing pollutants that get into people’s lungs, some have played a shell game, swapping a new measure of “pollution” based solely on emissions of carbon dioxide.  The problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is. CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic. Plants depend on it to live and grow, and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever.  Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.  Current levels of carbon dioxide concentration in the environment are substantially lower than they have been during earlier periods in the planet’s history. Without human intervention, the concentration of CO2 has climbed as high as 7,000 parts per million (ppm) in prior eras, whereas at present the concentration is just over 400 ppm.  Some experts, such as UN climate scientist Dr. Indur Goklany, have defended rising CO2 levels as a good thing for humanity. Goklany has argued that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere “is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally.”  “The benefits are real, whereas the costs of warming are uncertain,” he said.  While the United States must remain vigilant to keep the level of real, dangerous pollutants to a minimum, it may take some consolation in the fact that among G7 nations, it has the cleanest air of all.

acc4517a,"Why are climate-change models so flawed? Because climate science is so incomplete It was an accurate and judicious answer, so naturally it sent climate alarmists into paroxysms of condemnation. The Washington Post slammed Pruitt as a “denier” driven by “unreason.” Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii called Pruitt’s views “extreme” and “irresponsible” — proof of his unfitness to head the EPA. Gina McCarthy, who ran the agency under President Obama, bewailed the danger global warming poses “to all of us who call Earth home,” and said she couldn’t “imagine what additional information [Pruitt] might want from scientists” in order to understand that.  Replied Pruitt: “No. I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no — I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. But we don’t know that yet. We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.”  ‘Do you believe,” CNBC’s Joe Kernen asked Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency’s new director, in an interview last Thursday, “that it’s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob for climate?”  Yet for all the hyperventilating, Pruitt’s answer to the question he was asked — whether carbon dioxide is the climate’s “primary control knob” — was entirely sound. “We don’t know that yet,” he said. We don’t. CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent. Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all.  Advertisement  There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor, thereby increasing warming through a “positive feedback loop.” But that theory so far is mostly speculative; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed, nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred. It should go without saying that if scientists cannot yet make accurate predictions about future climate change, then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete.  Advertisement  Earth’s climate system is unfathomably complex. It is affected by innumerable interacting variables, atmospheric CO2 levels being just one. The more variables there are in any system or train of events, the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass. Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e., ½ x ½ Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable: just 1 in 8.  Apply that approach to climate change, and it becomes clear why the best response to the alarmists’ frantic predictions is a healthy skepticism.  The list of variables that shape climate includes cloud formation, topography, altitude, proximity to the equator, plate tectonics, sunspot cycles, volcanic activity, expansion or contraction of sea ice, conversion of land to agriculture, deforestation, reforestation, direction of winds, soil quality, El Niño and La Niña ocean cycles, prevalence of aerosols (airborne soot, dust, and salt) — and, of course, atmospheric greenhouse gases, both natural and manmade. A comprehensive list would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision.  Advertisement  But for the sake of argument, say there are merely 15 variables involved in predicting global climate change, and assume that climatologists have mastered each one to a near-perfect accuracy of 95 percent. What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable? Less than 50/50. (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.) Is it any surprise that climate-change predictions in the real world — where the complexities are exponentially greater and the exactitude of knowledge much less — have such a poor track record?  Pruitt got it right: Measuring human impacts on climate is indeed “very challenging.” The science is far from settled. That is why calls to radically reduce carbon emissions are so irresponsible — and why dire warnings of what will happen if we don’t are little better than reckless fearmongering.",partial
63b1812f,"Hurricane Florence is not climate change or global warming. It's just the weather. Hurricane Florence is not climate change or global warming. It's just the weather. Hurricane Florence is not the result of global warming. It's likely due to natural weather patterns, not climate change as some have already said.  Even before Hurricane Florence made landfall somewhere near the border of North and South Carolina, predicted damage from potentially catastrophic flooding from the storm was already being blamed on global warming.  Writing for NBC News, Kristina Dahl contended, “With each new storm, we are forced to question whether this is our new, climate change-fueled reality, and to ask ourselves what we can do to minimize the toll from supercharged storms.”  The theory is that tropical cyclones have slowed down in their speed by about 10 percent over the past 70 years due to a retreat of the jet stream farther north, depriving storms of steering currents and making them stall and keep raining in one location. This is what happened with Hurricane Harvey in Houston last year.  But like most claims regarding global warming, the real effect is small, probably temporary, and most likely due to natural weather patterns. Any changes in hurricanes over 70 years, even if real, can easily be part of natural cycles — or incomplete data. Coastal lake sediments along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline from 1,000 to 2,000 years ago suggest more frequent and intense hurricanes than occur today. Why? No one knows.  Unusual things happen in nature sometimes  The Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635 experienced a Category 3 or 4 storm, with up to a 20-foot storm surge. While such a storm does not happen in New England anymore, it happened again there in 1675, with elderly eyewitnesses comparing it to the 1635 storm.  Until 2017, the United States went 11 years without a major hurricane strike — something that is statistically very improbable. Nine years into that 11-year hurricane drought, a NASA scientist computed it as a 1-in-177-year event.  My point is that nature varies, and unusual things happen sometimes.  More: Is Trump some semi-God who conjured extreme weather?  Uncontrolled climate change could result in disaster for our kids. Will we do something?  We're keeping our Paris climate change commitments and our economies are booming: Governors  Now it’s fashionable to blame stalling hurricanes on global warming. In the case of Florence, the jet stream is indeed pushed farther north. But examination of a weather map of the atmospheric flow at an altitude of 18,000 feet shows the jet stream is pushed farther south over western North America. This kind of natural variation in atmospheric flow is called weather, not climate change. It’s just a roll of the dice. Hurricane-steering currents are subject to whatever the weather happens to be when they arrive at the U.S. coast.  No one should dismiss or minimize the damage that Florence will likely do. Hurricanes can be deadly. I completely agree with Ms. Dahl's NBC News piece that “right now, our number one priority has to be ensuring the safety of those in Florence’s evolving path, as well as the first responders helping them.”  The cost of storms has risen, not their severity  But a major hurricane hits North Carolina on average once every 20 years or so. The last was Fran in 1996, which is 22 years ago. Coastal residents know they live under a yearly threat of hurricanes, and sometimes (though relatively rarely), one of those hurricanes will be very strong.  Well, aren’t we being told these storms are getting stronger on average? The answer is no. The 30 most costly hurricanes in U.S. history (according to federal data from January) show no increase in intensity over time. The monetary cost of damages has increased dramatically in recent decades, but that is due to increasing population, wealth and the amount of vulnerable infrastructure. It’s not due to stronger storms.  If humans have any influence on hurricanes at all, it probably won’t be evident for many decades to come. Natural variability is simply too large. This should not be surprising given that humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions have caused only a 1 percent change in the natural energy flows coursing through the climate system.  Roy W.

46e9b5bb,"Scientists warn of 'global climate emergency' over shifting jet stream Two environmentalists have declared a “global climate emergency” after the Northern hemisphere jet stream was found to have crossed the equator, bringing “unprecedented” changes to the world’s weather patterns.  Robert Scribbler and University of Ottawa researcher Paul Beckwith warned of the “weather-destabilising and extreme weather-generating” consequences of the jet stream shift.  However other scientists dismissed their claims, with one describing their concern over wind crossing the equator as total nonsense.  Scribbler and Beckwith said the anomalies were most likely precipitated by man-made climate change, which caused the jet stream to slow down and create larger waves.  Scribbler wrote in a post on his environmental blog on Tuesday: “It’s the very picture of weather-weirding due to climate change. Something that would absolutely not happen in a normal world. Something, that if it continues, basically threatens seasonal integrity.  The blogger explained the barrier between the two jet streams generates the strong divide between summer and winter, and the “death of winter” could commence if it is eroded as warm weather leaks into the “winter zone” of the year.

de2b62d8,"Scientists say halting deforestation 'just as urgent' as reducing emissions The role of forests in combating climate change risks being overlooked by the world’s governments, according to a group of scientists that has warned halting deforestation is “just as urgent” as eliminating the use of fossil fuels.  Razing the world’s forests would release more than 3 trillion tons of carbon dioxide, more than the amount locked in identified global reserves of oil, coal and gas. By protecting and restoring forests, the world would achieve 18% of the emissions mitigation needed by 2030 to avoid runaway climate change, the group of 40 scientists, spanning five countries, said in a statement.  “We must protect and maintain healthy forests to avoid dangerous climate change and to ensure the world’s forests continue to provide services critical for the well-being of the planet and ourselves,” the statement reads.  The intervention comes as the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gathers in South Korea ahead of Monday’s release of an eagerly awaited report on how the world can avoid warming of 1.5C (2.7F) beyond pre-industrial levels, an aspirational target of the landmark Paris climate deal in 2015.  It is expected the report will focus on required changes to the energy system, rather than forests. “In responding to the IPCC report, our message as scientists is simple: Our planet’s future climate is inextricably tied to the future of its forests,” the scientists’ statement pointedly concludes.  Trees and other vegetation currently absorb around a quarter of the CO 2 humans are adding to the atmosphere, softening the potential impact of climate change.  While the world won’t lose all of its trees, large tracts of tropical forests, which hold a vast amount of carbon, are still being lost in the Amazon, central Africa and Indonesia. Warming temperatures are also fueling huge fires in forests in higher latitudes, as witnessed this summer when much of northern Sweden was aflame.  “The forest piece of the conversation is often lost and I don’t think the IPCC report will highlight it enough,” said Deborah Lawrence, a professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and a signatory of the statement. “We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year, which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink.  “Deforestation has been massively reduced in the Amazon, but that hasn’t happened elsewhere. As countries get more peaceful in Africa we could lose more tropical forests, which really worries me.”  The IPCC’s report is expected to mention the need for as-yet unproven technology to burn vegetation and bury the resulting emissions underground or directly suck carbon from the air as a way to meet the 1.5C target.  The statement by Lawrence and other scientists warns the former strategy, known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (Beccs), is untested and risks wiping out huge areas of rainforest in order to make way for plantation timber for energy.  “It breaks my heart to think we’d lose half our tropical forests for plantations just to save ourselves,” Lawrence said. “It’s horrifying that we’d lose our biodiversity to avert climate change. Losing tropical forests is not somehow cheaper than putting up wind farms in the US or Sahara.”  Lawrence said a steep drop in emissions to zero by 2040 would negate the need for “negative emissions” technology that would damage forests’ ability to suck up carbon, maintain local water supplies and weather patterns and provide a home for a riot of birds, mammals, insects and other creatures.  “We will have a hotter, drier world without these forests,” Lawrence said. “There needs to be an international price on carbon to fund the protection of forests. And countries with tropical forests should maintain large chunks of forests to stabilize rainfall for agriculture and keep a predictable regional climate.”  The prospects for averting at least 1.5C of warming appear dim, however, with a co-author of the upcoming IPCC report warning last week the world is “nowhere near on track” to meet its Paris commitments.",partial
71f6e8fd,"NASA releases time-lapse of the disappearing Arctic polar ice cap This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.  NASA posted this video to YouTube with this description, “Arctic sea ice has not only been shrinking in surface area in recent years, it’s becoming younger and thinner as well. In this animation, where the ice cover almost looks gelatinous as it pulses through the seasons, cryospheric scientist Dr. Walt Meier of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center describes how the sea ice has undergone fundamental changes during the era of satellite measurements.”  2017 was once again one of the hottest years on record, ranked as the second-warmest by NASA and third-warmest by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The findings “continue the planet’s long-term warming trend,” according to NASA. A trend that is driven predominately by human activity through carbon dioxide emissions.  Temperature records for the planet, monitored independently by both agencies, go back to 1880. The announcement came at a joint press conference on Thursday in Washington.  The hottest year on record remains 2016, while 2015 ranks second according to NOAA and third by NASA, which means the top three years have been the most recent three.  Though 2017 was slightly cooler on average compared to 2016. the trend towards a warmer planet has never been clearer.  The six hottest years have all occurred since 2010 and 17 of the 18 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001.  According to NASA, the globally averaged temperature of the land and ocean was 0.9˚C (1.62˚F) above the 20th century average. This puts us well over halfway to the ambitious target of limiting warming to 1.5˚ C (2.7˚F) set in the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement.  Scientists believe if that if we are to avoid exceeding that limit, carbon emissions would need to be significantly reduced starting immediately.  La Niña not enough to cool us down  The slight downturn in temperatures this year can be partially explained by the presence of La Niña, which began in late 2016 and lasted into 2017 and returned late in the year — whereas a robust El Niño was in place during portions of 2015 and 2016.  El Niño is characterized by a warming of the surface waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean — which tends to drive up global temperatures. Therefore years containing El Niños tend to be warmer globally than other years.  La Niñas, on the other hand, feature cooler than average waters in the Pacific, and tend to cool the planet down.  The fact that 2017 was the second- or third-warmest year on record, despite the presence of a cooling La Niña, speaks to the overall warming trend the Earth is experiencing thanks to overall global warming.  According to NASA, if “the effects of the recent El Niño and La Niña patterns were statistically removed from the record, 2017 would have been the warmest year on record.”  Global climate highlights of 2017  Sea ice continued its declining trend, both in the Arctic and Antarctic. The Antarctic, which was trending at record high levels just a few years ago, reached a record low during 2017, with ice covering 154,000 fewer square miles than the previous record low set in 1986.  In the Arctic, sea ice extent was the second-lowest since records began in 1979, behind only 2016, though record low sea ice was observed during the winter months of January-March.  Temperatures significantly warmer than normal around the planet did not mean there was a lack of snow, however. In the northern hemisphere, the average snow cover extent was the largest since 1985 and the eighth largest since records began in 1968, according to Rutgers University’s Global Snow Lab.  2017 also featured a number of extreme weather events, most notably the record number of major hurricanes impacting the US and Caribbean, which led to the costliest year for weather disasters in US history.",partial
ba39a59d,"Nolte: Scientists Prove Man-Made Global Warming Is a Hoax The far-left ThinkProgress reports that scientists have finally proven that the theory of man-made Global Warming is a total hoax.  Of course, no one will admit it, but that is exactly what has happened.  A new scientific study shows has revealed the following:  Current CO2 levels of 410 parts per million (ppm) were last seen on Earth three million years ago, according to the most detailed reconstruction of the Earth’s climate by researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and published in Science Advances.  Yes, you read that correctly, three million — million — years ago CO2 levels on Earth were the same as they are today, but there is one major difference between three million years ago and today…  Three million years ago, we humans were not driving cars or eating the meat that requires cow farts; we weren’t barbecuing or refusing to recycle or building factories; there was no Industrial Age, no plastic, no air conditioning, no electricity, no lumber mills, no consumerism, no aerosols.  In fact, three million years ago, there were probably no human beings on Earth, at least not human in the way we use that term today. And yet…  CO2 levels were the same then as they are now…  Hmmm…?  But I thought humans warmed the planet? That’s the hustle we’ve been sold for three decades now — you know, that WE are the problem.  We have also been told the problem is DEFINITELY NOT a billions-year-old planet running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit. Oh, no, that could never be it — so stop saying that could be, you Denier.  Well, what about the Ice Age that occurred thousands and thousands of years before the Industrial Age.  Shut up, Denier.  And yet…  According to the study, scientists also discovered that during this period of Global Warming “there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica, and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone.”  How is this possible 2,999,971 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger bought his Hummer?  It gets worse:  Temperatures were up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer globally, at least double that at the poles, and sea levels were some 20 meters (65 feet) higher.  How is that possible 2,999,945 years before Americans moved to the suburbs and lit up the charcoal grills?  Naturally, even in the face of a study that totally debunks the whole concept of man-made Global Warming, ThinkProgress is sticking with that hoax but is also forced to concede the following:  The good news is that the Earth does not warm instantly, and mile-thick ice sheets melt even more slowly. So the temperature rise will take several decades, and tens of feet of sea level rise will take hundreds and hundreds of years.  But-but-but-but Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy told me we only have 12 years!  And then ThinkProgress drops this anti-science stink bomb:  That means the choices we make now can affect the rate of rise and determine whether we blow past 65 feet of sea level rise to beyond 200 feet.  Because, because, because Orange Man Bad:  Even worse, the climate policy agenda President Donald Trump is pushing — actions that include rolling back U.S. laws that reduce carbon pollution and abandoning the Paris climate agreement — would lock us in to such high CO2 levels, sea levels would rise a foot per decade in just a few decades.  No, actually, what this study proves is that there is nothing we can do to stop the Earth’s naturally occurring climate cycles. Even the worst of the worst, even the most maniacal pushing the Global Warming Hoax admit that, at best, we can only cool the planet a couple of degrees, which will do next to nothing if the planet is determined to again warm itself by seven degrees, as we now know it did 2,999,998 years before the Bad Orange Man approved a couple of pipelines.

4854c659,"DELINGPOLE: ‘Global Warming’ Is a Myth, Say 58 Scientific Papers in 2017 “Global warming” is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017.  In other words, the so-called “Consensus” on global warming is a massive lie. And Donald Trump was quite right to quit the Paris agreement which pretended that the massive lie was true.  By “global warming” these papers don’t, of course, mean the mild warming of around 0.8 degrees Celsius that the planet has experienced since the middle of the 19th century as the world crawled out of the Little Ice Age. Pretty much everyone, alarmists and skeptics alike, is agreed on that.  Rather, they mean “global warming” in the sense that is most commonly used today by grant-troughing scientists, and huxter politicians, and scaremongering green activists, and brainwashed mainstream media (MSM) environmental correspondents. “Global warming” as in the scary, historically unprecedented, primarily man-made phenomenon which we must address urgently before the icecaps melt and the Pacific islands disappear beneath the waves and all the baby polar bears drown.  What all these papers argue in their different ways is that the alarmist version of global warming — aka Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW) — is a fake artefact.  That is, all these different experts from around the world — China, Russia, Canada, the U.S., Italy, etc. — have been looking closely at different aspects of the global warming puzzle in various regions and on different timescales and come to the conclusion in irreproachable, peer-reviewed scientific ways that there is no evidence to support the global warming scare story.  Late 20th century and early 21st century global warming, they show, is neither dramatic, nor unusual, nor scary.  Here, as collated by Kenneth Richard at No Tricks Zone, are just some of the charts to prove it.  Büntgen et al, below, shows that temperatures in the northern hemisphere were warmer in the early 1400s than they are today  Abrantes et al (below) confirms the traditional view — which Michael Mann tried to dismiss with his discredited Hockey Stick chart — that the Medieval Warming Period was warmer than anything we have experienced in our own era.  Here’s one from Li et al showing that China was much warmer 8,000 years ago  Here’s an unusual one from Guillet et al suggesting that there’s nothing new about wildly early or late grape harvests through the centuries:  And on and on it goes — there are 80 graphs in all, each showing in its different way why the scare about global warming has been horribly overdone because the evidence just doesn’t support its being unusual or a problem. Several of the papers note that the primary influence on warming appears to be solar activity. Few, if any, entertain the notion that carbon dioxide levels have much to do with it.  The intellectually corrupt and mendacious alarmist science establishment — I’m thinking, for example, of my personal bete noir, the left-wing political activist and Nobel-prizewinning geneticist Sir Paul Nurse, former president of the Royal Society — would have us believe that climate skepticism is a minority activity, the preserve of a few cranks, championed only by people who don’t do the science. But this is just ugly propaganda.  Here are dozens of reputable scientists from around the world with no axe to grind collaborating on studies which all corroborate, independently and rigorously, the increasingly respectable view that “man-made global warming” just isn’t a thing.  Not that it ever was a thing, really. This debate — as I argue at some length in Watermelons — was always about left-wing ideology, quasi-religious hysteria, and “follow the money” corruption, never about “science.”  Still, it’s always a comfort to know that “the science” is on our side too.

da8075a2,"3 billion people — up to half the current global population — could be living in unbearable heat in 50 years More than 3 billion people could potentially end up living in unbearable heat in the next 50 years, a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America showed.  While the worst-case scenario says 3 billion people may be impacted, the Associated Press reported that the more likely scenarios from the study show that at least one billion people will be affected.  The number of people impacted depends on what action is taken to reduce carbon emissions.  There are currently 20 million people impacted by extremely high temperatures.  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.  As many as half of the current world's population could be dealing with unlivable heat by 2070, a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America showed.  In the next 50 years, somewhere between 1 to 3 billion people are expected to be inflicted with unbearable heat, according to the study. By 2070, that could be about a third of the overall global population at that time.  Marten Scheffer of Wageningen University in the Netherlands, an ecologist and co-author of the study, told the Associated Press the projections are unlivable for the ordinary, for poor people, for the average world citizen.  The actual number of people affected will depend on how fast the global population grows and the levels of carbon emissions, the AP reported.  While the worst-case scenario expects over 3 billion people to be impacted, more likely scenarios from the study show that at least 1 billion people will be affected, the AP reported.  It's a huge amount, and it's a short time. This is why we're worried, Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald told the AP.  Mahowald wasn't apart of the study but told the AP that the new study makes sense and conveys the urgency of the man-made climate change differently than past research.  Scheffer told the AP that for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit increase in global average annual temperature from man-made climate change, about a billion people will end up in areas too warm to live.  Greenhouse gas emissions have to be reduced so average annual temperatures don't rise beyond the approximately 52 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit yearly average that humans have been able to thrive in for the past 6,000 years, USA Today reported.  We show that in a business-as-usual climate change scenario, the geographical position of this temperature niche is projected to shift more over the coming 50 years than it has moved (in the past 6,000 years), the study said.  The AP reported that the range was found after scientists looked at humans like they do bears, birds, and bees to find the 'climate niche' where people and civilizations flourish. While humans can live in hotter and colder weather, the further away from that range the harder it is.  The researchers looked at areas most likely to experience the change in range and estimated that around 2 billion people will be living there in the next 50 years.  The study found that large parts of Africa, Asia, South America, and Australia are likely to increase their temperature similar to what 20 million people are already experiencing in places like the Sahara Desert where the annual average temperature is more than 84 degrees Fahrenheit, the AP reported.  Large areas of the planet would heat to barely survivable levels and they wouldn't cool down again, Scheffer told USA Today. Not only would this have devastating direct effects, it leaves societies less able to cope with future crises like new pandemics. The only thing that can stop this happening is a rapid cut in carbon emissions.",partial
5c3d8916,"Scientists Announce That The Great Barrier Reef is Officially “Terminal” The Great Barrier Reef  Why care about reefs? In a word—biodiversity. The reef is home to 3,000 varieties of mollusks, over a hundred types of jellyfish, 1,625 species of fish, hundreds of shark and ray species, and over 30 kinds of whales and dolphins. These sea creatures call the soft and hard corals that make up the reef “home.” And without it, many of them will die.  If that’s not enough, it has the distinction of being the largest living structure on the planet.  The Great Barrier Reef is home to 3,000 individual coral reefs stretching across a staggering 2,575 kilometers (1,600 miles), covering an area of about 344,400 square kilometers (133,000 square miles.)  Unfortunately, because of back to back mass bleaching events, scientists are telling us that the massive, impressive Australian Great Barrier Reef is now at a ‘terminal stage’—with large portions having no hope of recovery.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Mass bleaching, a phenomenon caused by global warming, is prompted when the water warms to a point that corals begin ejecting the symbiotic algae in their tissue, essential for their survival. Throughout history, there have only been four instances of this occurrence, and after such an event, it will take decades to recover.  “This is the fourth time the Great Barrier Reef has bleached severely – in 1998, 2002, 2016, and now in 2017. Bleached corals are not necessarily dead corals, but in the severe central region we anticipate high levels of coral loss,” said researcher James Kerry, from James Cook University’s ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, in an official statement. He clarifies why the 2017 bleaching is significant: “It takes at least a decade for a full recovery of even the fastest growing corals, so mass bleaching events 12 months apart offers zero prospect of recovery for reefs that were damaged in 2016.”  Death Toll  The newest aerial surveys covered over 8,000 kilometers (5,000) miles, which includes 800 individual coral reefs.  According to the surveys, 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) of the Great Barrier Reef is now bleached. These new statistics come less than a year after 93 percent of the reef suffered severe damage, with reports adding that the effects have also spread further south.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Combined with the mass bleaching event, the arrival of Tropical Cyclone Debbie added to the devastation, as it struck a section of the reef that managed to escape the worst of the bleaching.  In an interview with The Guardian, scientists note just how dire the situation is. “We’ve given up,” said Jon Brodie, a James Cook University water quality expert, who was referring to inaction on the part of the Australian government. “It’s been my life managing water quality, we’ve failed.”  Unfortunately, in this age of global warming, temperatures are expected to continue rising, which means more of these bleaching events will happen, and they will cause even more damage. And the reality is, this could be the last generation who will get to see the grand beauty of this reef.  Fortunately, it’s not too late for us to save the rest of the planet from the worst effects of climate change. But we must act now.

43daeaa5,"What California’s Dam Crisis Says About the Changing Climate - The New York Times The recent drought has highlighted the pressure that a changing climate puts on a snowpack-dependent water system. With the shift toward more rain rather than snow, and the earlier melting of the snowpack, water managers need to release water more frequently for flood control. This dynamic is playing out in Oroville now, with the state’s water managers racing to empty water from the dam’s reservoir in advance of storms forecast to arrive Wednesday. Because these storms are relatively warm, they are likely to bring rain to the surrounding mountains, speeding the flow of water behind the dam.  The juxtaposition of five years of hot, dry conditions followed by more rain than reservoirs can store may seem incongruous. However, this is exactly what climate scientists have predicted for California since at least the 1980s: protracted periods of warm, dry conditions punctuated by intense wet spells, with more rain and less snow, causing both drought and floods. Recent work from my lab shows that in fact this pattern is already emerging, with the conditions that create extremely warm dry years and extremely wet years both becoming more frequent.  The other bitter reality is that this extremely wet winter will not wash away the drought. Depending where one looks, California lost out on one to three full years of precipitation from 2012 to 2016. That is a lot of water to make up in one year, and as of last week almost half of California was still in a state of drought. The moisture deficits that have accumulated during the drought have not been seen in our lifetimes. They have caused thousands of California residents to go without running water, resulted in groundwater contamination and permanent loss of aquifer storage capacity, and have severely stressed tens of millions of trees. As a result, even after this wet year, rural communities, groundwater aquifers and forest ecosystems will still feel the effects of the drought.  As the last five years illustrate, California’s water system is not equipped for climate change’s “new normal.” That water system must simultaneously provide for the country’s largest population and agricultural sector, and one of its most diverse natural environments. Although California has greatly improved water-use efficiency in the last half-century, climate change is pushing our water system to the limit. Investments in “climate smart” infrastructure can ensure the safety and security of Americans in the face of climate stresses now and in the future. These investments in infrastructure upgrades and expansion would create jobs, protect communities from disasters and help prepare us for changes in the climate. This effort would have several key elements:  First, given the new climate normal in which protracted hot, dry periods are far more common, we need to deploy technologies that can increase water supply. While expensive, energy-intensive desalination options have received considerable attention, wastewater recycling technologies have improved to the point that clean, safe water can now be delivered at reduced energy cost and can even be an energy source by using the organic matter in wastewater to produce energy. Investments in infrastructure to capture, store and clean urban storm water will also create new sources of water supply.",partial

In Salida, Colorado, residents have noticed the change through more lawn watering, increased air conditioning sales and bigger fires. (June 18) AP  Collapsing polar ice caps, a green Sahara Desert, a 20-foot sea-level rise.  That's the potential future of Earth, a new study suggests, noting that global warming could be twice as warm as current climate models predict.  The rate of warming is also remarkable: “The changes we see today are much faster than anything encountered in Earth’s history. In terms of rate of change, we are in uncharted waters,” said study co-author Katrin Meissner of the University of New South Wales in Australia.  This could mean the landmark Paris Climate Agreement – which seeks to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels – may not be enough to ward off catastrophe.  “Even with just 2 degrees of warming – and potentially just 1.5 degrees – significant impacts on the Earth system are profound,” said study co-author Alan Mix, a scientist from Oregon State University.  “We can expect that sea-level rise could become unstoppable for millennia, impacting much of the world’s population, infrastructure and economic activity,” Mix said.  In looking at Earth's past, scientists can predict what the future will look like. In the study, the researchers looked back at natural global warming periods over the past 3.5 million years and compared them to current man-made warming.  By combining a wide range of measurements from ice cores, sediment layers, fossil records, dating using atomic isotopes and many other established paleoclimate methods, the researchers pieced together the impact of those climatic changes.  Human-inflicted climate change is caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which release heat-trapping greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the the atmosphere.  Study lead author Hubertus Fischer of the University of Bern in Switzerland and his team found that our current climate predictions may underestimate long-term warming by as much as a factor of two.  Meissner said that climate models appear to be trustworthy for small changes, such as for low-emission scenarios over short periods, say over the next few decades out to 2100. But as the change gets larger or more persistent ... it appears they underestimate climate change.  The research also revealed how large areas of the polar ice caps could collapse and significant changes to ecosystems could see the Sahara Desert become green and the edges of tropical forests turn into fire-dominated savanna.  However, Meissner said we cannot comment on how far in the future these changes will occur.  Referring to the study findings, lead author Fischer said that without serious reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, there is very little margin for error to meet the Paris targets.”  The study, which was conducted by dozens of researchers from 17 countries, was published last week in Nature Geoscience, a peer-reviewed British journal.",truth
82e146cc,"The Sea Level Around Florida Is Rising Six Times Faster Than Average It really is hard to overstate how screwed Florida is when it comes to climate change. Sea level rise has already ensured that floods are becoming common, not freak weather extremes; it’s guaranteeing that hurricanes and their associated storm surges are just getting that much more powerful.  Despite all this evidence, however, Governors and Senators who are often climate change deniers still get voted back into power there. As a result, instead of investing in climate change prevention measures, streets in Miami are literally getting raised up off the ground to stop floodwater coming in.  A new study, published in Geophysical Research Letters, suggests that even this ludicrously short-sighted measure won’t be enough to stop the incoming tide. Sea level rise around the globe is accelerating year-on-year, but along the Floridian coastline, it’s rising up three to six times faster than average.  A team of researchers from the University of Florida took into account a wide range of factors when it came to determining why this was happening. After all, regional sea level rise changes are very complex, and no single mechanism is solely to blame.  When it comes to human influence, there are two inputs: the melting ice caps, and thermal expansion. The former is obvious – terrestrial ice that melts, falls into the sea and disintegrates causes the sea level to rise first in the region, and then globally.  The latter relates to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; the more there is, the hotter the planet’s surface gets, and the hotter the oceans get. Warm water expands, and normally the only way to expand is upwards.  When it comes to natural cycles, sea level changes take place on short timescales normally because an oceanic current, one that shifts water from place to place, has changed. El Niño, the epic and all-encompassing climatic phenomenon that takes place every 2-7 years, can affect these oceanic currents.  This new study suggests that Florida’s sea level rise “hot spot” is being caused mostly by these natural factors. A recent, particularly powerful El Niño and a sudden weakening in the atmospheric pressure over the region - thanks to a feature known as the North Atlantic Oscillation - conspired to allow water levels to rise sharply.  “The superposition of these two ocean-atmospheric processes accounts for 87% of the variance in the spatiotemporal pattern of intradecadal sea level oscillations,” the team note – meaning that by far, natural processes are responsible for this unusual hot spot of sea level rise.  It cannot be ignored, though, that human contributions to climate change are only exacerbating this further. All in all, it’s bad news for Florida’s near-future, which is set to be underwater faster than anyone has previously estimated.  Another study revealed that, by 2100, there will be 2 billion climate refugees – and several million of them will be migrating from Florida to places further inland. If that’s not the future you want, it’s probably best to vote for lawmakers who’ll do something about it.  [H/T: Scientific American]  Update: Roll of North Atlantic Oscillation made more explicit.

b509780b,"Jerry Brown Blames Climate Change for California Fires: ‘The New Normal’ California Governor Jerry Brown blamed climate change for the California fires that have devastated the state this fall during a visit to assess the damage in Ventura County on Saturday.  “This is the new normal,” he said, as quoted by the Orange County Register. “We’re facing a new reality where fires threaten peoples’ lives, their properties, their neighborhoods and cost billions and billions of dollars. We have to have the resources to combat the fires, and also have to invest in managing our vegetation and forests and all the ways we dwell in this very wonderful place — but a place that’s getting hotter.”  However, climate scientists are more skeptical, noting that climate change could be one of a variety of factors.  A comprehensive look at the question by Southern California Public Radio — hardly a conservative outlet — found that there was considerable debate about the factors that made this year’s fires particularly bad.  One factor was high winds, whose connection to climate change is “still up for debate.” Another factor was the state’s recent drought, which persisted in the part of Southern California where the Thomas fire — now in excess of 150,000 acres, with only 15% containment — struck. (Ironically, last winter’s heavy rains caused brush to grow rapidly, giving fires plenty of fuel to burn.)  An important factor in the fires of the past week was that people are building homes in areas that are naturally prone to wildfires, or where naturally dry conditions mean that the kinds of building materials and vegetation that people prefer to use in cities and suburbs are a fire hazard.  Brown has frequently cited climate change as the cause for natural disasters before, only to be corrected by scientists, who suggested he was guilty of “noble-cause corruption” — i.e. distorting science in service of a cause that many scientists support.  Last year, both Brown and then-President Barack Obama falsely linked wildfires across the western United States to climate change. And last month, Brown told a conference at the Vatican that the world needed “brain washing” on climate change.  Aside from the Thomas fire, firefighters have made significant progress in their struggle against some of the other fires burning across the region. The Skirball fire near the 405 Freeway, which brought traffic to a standstill in Los Angeles on Thursday, was at 75 percent containment as of Saturday afternoon, according to Southern California Public Radio. The Lilac fire, which killed several dozen horses on Thursday, was fully contained by Saturday evening, according to the Register.  “The Creek Fire was now 80% contained, and the Rye Fire was 65% contained” as of Saturday, the Los Angeles Times reported.  Officials say there have been no deaths associated with the Southern California fires.  Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

d17185d3,"If Everyone Ate Beans Instead of Beef Like what?  Helen Harwatt is a researcher trained in environmental nutrition, a field focused on developing food systems that balance human health and sustainability. She’s interested in policy, but realistic about how much progress can be expected under the aforementioned leadership. So she and colleagues have done research on maximizing the impacts of individuals. As with so many things in life and health, that tends to come down to food.  Recently Harwatt and a team of scientists from Oregon State University, Bard College, and Loma Linda University calculated just what would happen if every American made one dietary change: substituting beans for beef. They found that if everyone were willing and able to do that—hypothetically—the U.S. could still come close to meeting its 2020 greenhouse-gas emission goals, pledged by President Barack Obama in 2009.  That is, even if nothing about our energy infrastructure or transportation system changed—and even if people kept eating chicken and pork and eggs and cheese—this one dietary change could achieve somewhere between 46 and 74 percent of the reductions needed to meet the target.  “I think there’s genuinely a lack of awareness about how much impact this sort of change can have,” Harwatt told me. There have been analyses in the past about the environmental impacts of veganism and vegetarianism, but this study is novel for the idea that a person’s dedication to the cause doesn’t have to be complete in order to matter. A relatively small, single-food substitution could be the most powerful change a person makes in terms of their lifetime environmental impact—more so than downsizing one’s car, or being vigilant about turning off light bulbs, and certainly more than quitting showering.  Read: The economic case for worldwide vegetarianism  To understand why the climate impact of beef alone is so large, note that the image at the top of this story is a sea of soybeans in a silo in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. The beans belong to a feed lot that holds 38,000 cattle, the growth and fattening of which means dispensing 900 metric tons of feed every day. Which is to say that these beans will be eaten by cows, and the cows will convert the beans to meat, and the humans will eat the meat. In the process, the cows will emit much greenhouse gas, and they will consume far more calories in beans than they will yield in meat, meaning far more clearcutting of forests to farm cattle feed than would be necessary if the beans above were simply eaten by people.  This inefficient process happens on a massive scale. Brazil, the world’s largest exporter of red meat, holds around 212 million cattle. (In June, the U.S. temporarily suspended imports of beef from Brazil due to abscesses, collections of pus, in the meat.) According to the United Nations, 33 percent of arable land on Earth is used to grow feed for livestock. Even more, 26 percent of the ice-free terrestrial surface of Earth is used for grazing livestock. In all, almost a third of the land on Earth is used to produce meat and animal products.",other

USA TODAY  It was December 1984, and President Reagan had just been elected to his second term, Dynasty was the top show on TV and Madonna's Like a Virgin topped the musical charts.  It was also the last time the Earth had a cooler-than-average month.  Last month marked the planet's 400th consecutive month with above-average temperatures, federal scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Thursday.  The cause for the streak? Unquestionably, it’s climate change, caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels.  We live in and share a world that is unequivocally, appreciably and consequentially warmer than just a few decades ago, and our world continues to warm, said NOAA climate scientist Deke Arndt. Speeding by a '400' sign only underscores that, but it does not prove anything new.  Climate scientists use the 20th-century average as a benchmark for global temperature measurements. That's because it's fixed in time, allowing for consistent goal posts when reviewing climate data. It's also a sufficiently long period to include several cycles of climate variability.  The thing that really matters is that, by whatever metric, we've spent every month for several decades on the warm side of any reasonable baseline, Arndt said.  NOAA's analysis found last month was the 3rd-warmest April on record globally. The unusual heat was most noteworthy in Europe, which had its warmest April on record, and Australia, which had its second-warmest.  Portions of Asia also experienced some extreme heat: In southern Pakistan, the town of Nawabshah soared to a scalding 122.4 degrees on April 30, which may have been the warmest April temperature on record for the globe, according to Meteo France.  Argentina also had its warmest April since national records began there in 1961.  North America was the one part of the world that didn't get in on the heat parade. Last month, the average U.S. temperature was 48.9 degrees, 2.2 degrees below average, making it the 13th-coldest April on record and the coldest since 1997, NOAA said.  More: Spring shiver: Last month was USA's coldest April in more than 20 years  More: Earth's carbon dioxide levels continue to soar, at highest point in 800,000 years  For the year-to-date, the Earth is seeing its 5th-warmest start to the year.  A separate analysis of global temperature data from NASA also found last month was the third-warmest April on record.  Another milestone was reached in April, also related to the number 400: Carbon dioxide — the gas scientists say is most responsible for global warming — reached its highest level in recorded history at 410 parts per million.  This amount is highest in at least the past 800,000 years, according to the Scripps Institute of Oceanography.",truth
0a68da63,"Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has worst coral die-off ever Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has worst coral die-off ever  One of the world’s treasures, the Great Barrier Reef, just suffered from its worst coral die-off ever recorded, Australian scientists announced Monday.  Record coral kill-off on Great Barrier Reef Scientists confirm a mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef this year has killed more corals than ever before, with more than two thirds destroyed across large swathes of the biodiverse site. Video provided by AFP Newslook  Stress from unusually warm ocean water heated by man-made climate change and the natural El Niño climate pattern caused the die-off. The coral was cooked,” Terry Hughes, director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, told the BBC.  At more than 1,400 miles long, Australia's Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef and the planet's biggest structure made by living organisms. In the northernmost section of the reef, which had been considered the most pristine, some 67% of the coral died.  The good news, scientists said, was that central and southern sections of the reef fared far better, with only 6% and 1% of the coral dead, respectively.  Coral reefs result from the work of little polyps, creatures only a few millimeters long, budded on top of one another. Over centuries, the shells of these creatures combine to form the exotic shapes of coral reefs. Tiny differences in the anatomy of each polyp species affect the shape of their shells and produce the exotic shapes of each reef.  The vibrant colors that draw thousands of tourists to the Great Barrier Reef each year come from algae that live in the corals tissue. When water temperatures become too high, coral becomes stressed and expels the algae, which leave the coral a bleached white color.  Mass coral bleaching is a new phenomenon and was never observed before the 1980s as global warming ramped up.  Besides their beauty, reefs shelter land from storms, and are also a habitat for myriads of species.  Coral reefs are therefore the most biologically diverse ecosystems of the planet, and provide a number of ecosystem services that hundreds of millions of people rely on, said Greg Torda, also of the Centre, in an e-mail to USA TODAY.  These include provisioning (fishing, other types of harvesting, for pharmaceuticals, for example), coastal protection, aesthetic and cultural values – to name a few. If corals are lost, so are all the services they provide to humans; and so are all the species that directly or indirectly rely on them.  Tourism on the Great Barrier Reef employs 70,000 people, and generates $5 billion (Australian) in income each year, the Centre said in a statement.  The good news is that much of the coral survived this bleaching event. But looking to the future, mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef will likely be an annual phenomenon within a decade, Torda said.  If all the coral died on the reef, “it would be among the largest mass extinction events in history,” said Torda.",truth
7fe3703e,"The American South Will Bear the Worst of Climate Change’s Costs Yet beyond its initial findings, the paper represents a major breakthrough for the field of climate economics. Previously, the best financial forecasts of climate change approximated damages for the entire country at once. This new study worked from the bottom up, building its model from dozens of microeconomic studies into how climate change is already affecting regional economies across the United States. Every algorithm in the model emerges from a previously observed relationship in real-world data.  “This is like the adults entering the room. Economists have, for a quarter century, insisted that more work needs to be done to estimate climate damages. This team has done so,” said Gernot Wagner, a researcher Harvard University and the former lead senior economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, in an email. He was not connected to the study.  But this emphasis on the observed means that the research omitted many serious risks of climate change—even those the researchers considered important—if the data describing them was too paltry. The estimates do not include “non-market goods” like the loss of biodiversity or natural splendor. In other words: Most people agree that dead polar bears have an economic cost, but there’s no consensus on how to approximate it.  The study also doesn’t account for the increased likelihood of “tail risks”—that is, unlikely events with catastrophic consequences. Many researchers believe that global warming will make social strife, mass migration, or global military calamity more likely, but those events are, by definition, hard to predict. The same goes for economic disaster prompted by the onset of a “mega-drought” or the rapid collapse of the Greenland ice sheet.  “When we had the Dust Bowl, we saw everyone clear out of the Midwest and flood labor markets in the urban centers on the coast,” said Hsiang. Nothing like this kind of internal migration is modeled in the Science study.  All in all, the study’s assessments should be interpreted as the most rigorous attempt ever to describe what global warming will cost the United States in a “normal” world. It describes an America that has retained a well-organized economy, held together as a political community, and benefitted from the ongoing general global peace that began 70 years ago.  Even in that harmonious world, climate change will make the United States pay.  What Climate Change Will Cost Every U.S. County, 2080–2099  (Kopp, Hsiang, et al. / Science)  Across the country’s southern half—and especially in states that border the Gulf of Mexico—climate change could impose the equivalent of a 20-percent tax on county-level income, according to the study.

db830542,"Has Climate Change Intensified 2017’s Western Wildfires? “This will become an important year for [anecdotes about] the importance of temperature. Despite the fact that these forests were really soaked down this winter and spring, these heat waves have dried things out enough to promote really large fires,” says Park Williams, a research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University.  In other words, the weeks of heat that baked the West in July and August were enough to wipe away some of the fire-dampening effect of the winter storms.  “The last 60 to 90 days have been exceptionally warm and dry, the perfect recipe for drying out fuels (the one ingredient besides ignitions you need for fire in these systems),” said John Abatzoglou, a professor of geography at the University of Idaho, in an email. “I was running a few numbers this morning, and the last 60 days have been record warm from Spokane, Washington, to Medford, Oregon; both Seattle and Missoula earlier this summer set records for the longest number of days without measurable rain.”  This excessive heat can have an outsize effect on the size of forest fires. For more than three decades, wildfire researchers have known that fire and aridity, which is controlled by heat, exist in an exponential relationship. Every degree of warming does more to promote fire than the previous degree of warming, Williams said.  “Now, thinking about temperature trends due to human-caused climate change, we think that the western United States is 1.5 [degrees] Celsius, or 3 degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than it would be in absence of climate change. And there’s a heat wave on top of that,” said Williams. “Because of the exponential influence of temperature, that means that this heat wave is having a way worse influence on fire than it would in absence of human-caused warming.”  In the runaway consequences of each additional degree of warming, wildfires are a “canary in the coal mine” for the effects of climate change, Williams said.  And global warming is already having an effect on wildfire. In a paper published last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Williams and Abatzoglou found that the total area burned in the western United States over the past 33 years was double the size it would have been without any human-caused warming.  “The added forest fire area—due to just the degree and a half Celsius of warming—equaled the area of Massachusetts and Connecticut combined,” Williams told me.  Other researchers have arrived at similar conclusions. A paper published in Science last year found that “large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons.” The mid-1980s is also when most scientists argue that the effects of global warming began to be broadly felt.",truth

It floats on top of the ocean.  Arctic sea ice this January averaged 5.17 million square miles, the lowest for the month in the 38-year sea ice record, the National Snow and Ice Data Center said.

The lack of ice in the Antarctic, where it is currently summer, is most pronounced in the Amundsen Sea, where only a few scattered patches of ice remain.  Sea ice in the Arctic affects wildlife such as polar bears, seals and walruses. It also helps regulate the planet’s temperature by influencing the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean.

John R. Christy, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville who is known for his skepticism about the seriousness of global warming, pointed out in an interview that 2014 had surpassed the other record-warm years by only a few hundredths of a degree, well within the error margin of global temperature measurements. “Since the end of the 20th century, the temperature hasn’t done much,” Dr. Christy said. “It’s on this kind of warmish plateau.”  Despite such arguments from a handful of scientists, the vast majority of those who study the climate say the earth is in a long-term warming trend that is profoundly threatening and caused almost entirely by human activity.  They expect the heat to get much worse over coming decades, but already it is killing forests around the world, driving plants and animals to extinction, melting land ice and causing the seas to rise at an accelerating pace.  “It is exceptionally unlikely that we would be witnessing a record year of warmth, during a record-warm decade, during a several decades-long period of warmth that appears to be unrivaled for more than a thousand years, were it not for the rising levels of planet-warming gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels,” Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at the Pennsylvania State University, said in an email.

The peer-reviewed study by two scientists and a veteran statistician looked at the global average temperature datasets (GAST) which are used by climate alarmists to argue that recent years have been “the hottest evah” and that the warming of the last 120 years has been dramatic and unprecedented.  What they found is that these readings are “totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data.”  That is, the adjusted data used by alarmist organizations like NASA, NOAA, and the UK Met Office differs so markedly from the original raw data that it cannot be trusted.  This chart gives you a good idea of the direction of the adjustments.  The blue bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted downwards to make it cooler; the red bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted upwards to make it warmer.  Note how most of the downward adjustments take place in the early twentieth century and most of the upward take place in the late twentieth century.  According to meteorologist Joe D’Aleo, who co-authored the study with statistician James Wallace and Cato Institute climate scientist Craig Idso, this has the effect of exaggerating the warming trend:  “Nearly all of the warming they are now showing are in the adjustments.” “Each dataset pushed down the 1940s warming and pushed up the current warming.” “You would think that when you make adjustments you’d sometimes get warming and sometimes get cooling. That’s almost never happened.”  What this means, the report concludes, is that claims by NASA, NOAA, and the UK Met Office that the world is experiencing unprecedented and dramatic warming should be taken with a huge pinch of salt: they all use the same corrupted global average temperature (GAST) data.",partial
903d335b,"How Scientists Got Climate Change So Wrong - The New York Times For decades, most scientists saw climate change as a distant prospect. We now know that thinking was wrong. This summer, for instance, a heat wave in Europe penetrated the Arctic, pushing temperatures into the 80s across much of the Far North and, according to the Belgian climate scientist Xavier Fettweis, melting some 40 billion tons of Greenland’s ice sheet.  Had a scientist in the early 1990s suggested that within 25 years a single heat wave would measurably raise sea levels, at an estimated two one-hundredths of an inch, bake the Arctic and produce Sahara-like temperatures in Paris and Berlin, the prediction would have been dismissed as alarmist. But many worst-case scenarios from that time are now realities.  Science is a process of discovery. It can move slowly as the pieces of a puzzle fall together and scientists refine their investigative tools. But in the case of climate, this deliberation has been accompanied by inertia born of bureaucratic caution and politics. A recent essay in Scientific American argued that scientists “tend to underestimate the severity of threats and the rapidity with which they might unfold” and said one of the reasons was “the perceived need for consensus.” This has had severe consequences, diluting what should have been a sense of urgency and vastly understating the looming costs of adaptation and dislocation as the planet continues to warm.  In 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations group of thousands of scientists representing 195 countries, said in its first report that climate change would arrive at a stately pace, that the methane-laden Arctic permafrost was not in danger of thawing, and that the Antarctic ice sheets were stable.",partial

The finding that a record had been set for the third year in a row was released on Wednesday by three government agencies, two of them American and one British, that track measurements made by ships, buoys and land-based weather stations. They analyze the figures to correct for known problems, producing an annual average temperature for the surface of the Earth. The national meteorological agency of Japan confirmed the findings in a preliminary analysis.  In the British data set, 2016 set a record by only a small amount; the margin was larger in the NOAA data set and larger still in NASA’s. NASA does more work than the other groups to take full account of Arctic temperatures, and several scientists said they believed the NASA record to be the most accurate for 2016 for that reason.",truth
c32f210d,"Sea ice in Arctic and Antarctic at record lows Story highlights It's a key indicator of climate change and can mean changes to weather  Temperatures are 30 degrees above normal at the North Pole  (CNN) For what appears to be the first time since scientists began keeping track, sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic are at record lows this time of year.  It looks like, since the beginning of October, that for the first time we are seeing both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice running at record low levels, said Walt Meier, a research scientist with the Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, who has tracked sea ice data going back to 1979.  While record low sea ice is nothing new in the Arctic, this is a surprising turn of events for the Antarctic. Even as sea ice in the Arctic has seen a rapid and consistent decline over the past decade, its counterpart in the Southern Hemisphere has seen its extent increasing.  In fact, each year from 2012 through 2014 reached a record high for Antarctic sea ice extent. Skeptics have long pointed to ice gain in the Southern Hemisphere as evidence climate change wasn't occurring, but scientists warned that it was caused by natural variations and circulations in the atmosphere.  While it is too early to know if the recent, rapid decline in Antarctic sea ice is going to be a regular occurrence like in the Arctic, it certainly puts the kibosh on everyone saying that Antarctica's ice is just going up and up, Meier said.

4d9c4db8,"Seas Are Rising at Fastest Rate in Last 28 Centuries Though these types of floods often produce only a foot or two of standing saltwater, they are straining life in many towns by killing lawns and trees, blocking neighborhood streets and clogging storm drains, polluting supplies of freshwater and sometimes stranding entire island communities for hours by overtopping the roads that tie them to the mainland.  Such events are just an early harbinger of the coming damage, the new research suggests.  “I think we need a new way to think about most coastal flooding,” said Benjamin H. Strauss, the primary author of one of two related studies released on Monday. “It’s not the tide. It’s not the wind. It’s us. That’s true for most of the coastal floods we now experience.”  In the second study, scientists reconstructed the level of the sea over time and confirmed that it is most likely rising faster than at any point in 28 centuries, with the rate of increase growing sharply over the past century — largely, they found, because of the warming that scientists have said is almost certainly caused by human emissions.  They also confirmed previous forecasts that if emissions were to continue at a high rate over the next few decades, the ocean could rise as much as three or four feet by 2100.  Experts say the situation would then grow far worse in the 22nd century and beyond, likely requiring the abandonment of many coastal cities.",truth

But one leaked detail of her dinner the previous week with Jean‑Claude Juncker and the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is worth dwelling on.  To remind Mrs May of just what she and the EU are up against in the next 18 months, Juncker was said to have plonked on the table two documents, the EU’s trade deal with Canada and the EU’s accession treaty with Croatia in 2011.  Both are very relevant to our concerns, because Mrs May not only hopes to negotiate an unprecedented trade deal: at the end of the negotiations, there will also have to be a secession treaty, covering much of the same ground as an accession treaty, but in reverse.  The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), which gave Canada much less access to the European market than we enjoy now, is incredibly complex, covered 1,598 pages and took seven years to negotiate.

Researchers, led by University of Colorado-Boulder professor of aerospace engineering sciences Steve Nerem, used satellite data dating to 1993 to observe the levels of the world's oceans.  Changes in sea level observed between 1992 and 2014. Orange/red colors represent higher sea levels, while blue colors show where sea levels are lower.  Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.  The team observed a total rise in the ocean of 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) in 25 years of data, which aligns with the generally accepted current rate of sea level rise of about 3 millimeters (0.1 inches) per year.

62682d8e,"ENCYCLICAL LETTER LAUDATO SI’ OF THE HOLY FATHER FRANCIS ON CARE FOR OUR COMMON HOME 1. “LAUDATO SI’, mi’ Signore” – “Praise be to you, my Lord”. In the words of this beautiful canticle, Saint Francis of Assisi reminds us that our common home is like a sister with whom we share our life and a beautiful mother who opens her arms to embrace us. “Praise be to you, my Lord, through our Sister, Mother Earth, who sustains and governs us, and who produces various fruit with coloured flowers and herbs”.[1] 2. This sister now cries out to us because of the harm we have inflicted on her by our irresponsible use and abuse of the goods with which God has endowed her. We have come to see ourselves as her lords and masters, entitled to plunder her at will. The violence present in our hearts, wounded by sin, is also reflected in the symptoms of sickness evident in the soil, in the water, in the air and in all forms of life. This is why the earth herself, burdened and laid waste, is among the most abandoned and maltreated of our poor; she “groans in travail” (Rom 8:22). We have forgotten that we ourselves are dust of the earth (cf. Gen 2:7); our very bodies are made up of her elements, we breathe her air and we receive life and refreshment from her waters. Nothing in this world is indifferent to us 3. More than fifty years ago, with the world teetering on the brink of nuclear crisis, Pope Saint John XXIII wrote an Encyclical which not only rejected war but offered a proposal for peace. He addressed his message Pacem in Terris to the entire “Catholic world” and indeed “to all men and women of good will”. Now, faced as we are with global environmental deterioration, I wish to address every person living on this planet. In my Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Gaudium, I wrote to all the members of the Church with the aim of encouraging ongoing missionary renewal. In this Encyclical, I would like to enter into dialogue with all people about our common home. 4. In 1971, eight years after Pacem in Terris, Blessed Pope Paul VI referred to the ecological concern as “a tragic consequence” of unchecked human activity: “Due to an ill-considered exploitation of nature, humanity runs the risk of destroying it and becoming in turn a victim of this degradation”.[2] He spoke in similar terms to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations about the potential for an “ecological catastrophe under the effective explosion of industrial civilization”, and stressed “the urgent need for a radical change in the conduct of humanity”, inasmuch as “the most extraordinary scientific advances, the most amazing technical abilities, the most astonishing economic growth, unless they are accompanied by authentic social and moral progress, will definitively turn against man”.[3] 5. Saint John Paul II became increasingly concerned about this issue. In his first Encyclical he warned that human beings frequently seem “to see no other meaning in their natural environment than what serves for immediate use and consumption”.[4] Subsequently, he would call for a global ecological conversion.[5] At the same time, he noted that little effort had been made to “safeguard the moral conditions for an authentic human ecology”.[6] The destruction of the human environment is extremely serious, not only because God has entrusted the world to us men and women, but because human life is itself a gift which must be defended from various forms of debasement. Every effort to protect and improve our world entails profound changes in “lifestyles, models of production and consumption, and the established structures of power which today govern societies”.[7] Authentic human development has a moral character. It presumes full respect for the human person, but it must also be concerned for the world around us and “take into account the nature of each being and of its mutual connection in an ordered system”.[8] Accordingly, our human ability to transform reality must proceed in line with God’s original gift of all that is.[9] 6. My predecessor Benedict XVI likewise proposed “eliminating the structural causes of the dysfunctions of the world economy and correcting models of growth which have proved incapable of ensuring respect for the environment”.[10] He observed that the world cannot be analyzed by isolating only one of its aspects, since “the book of nature is one and indivisible”, and includes the environment, life, sexuality, the family, social relations, and so forth. It follows that “the deterioration of nature is closely connected to the culture which shapes human coexistence”.[11] Pope Benedict asked us to recognize that the natural environment has been gravely damaged by our irresponsible behaviour. The social environment has also suffered damage. Both are ultimately due to the same evil: the notion that there are no indisputable truths to guide our lives, and hence human freedom is limitless. We have forgotten that “man is not only a freedom which he creates for himself. Man does not create himself. He is spirit and will, but also nature”.[12] With paternal concern, Benedict urged us to realize that creation is harmed “where we ourselves have the final word, where everything is simply our property and we use it for ourselves alone. The misuse of creation begins when we no longer recognize any higher instance than ourselves, when we see nothing else but ourselves”.[13] United by the same concern 7. These statements of the Popes echo the reflections of numerous scientists, philosophers, theologians and civic groups, all of which have enriched the Church’s thinking on these questions. Outside the Catholic Church, other Churches and Christian communities – and other religions as well – have expressed deep concern and offered valuable reflections on issues which all of us find disturbing. To give just one striking example, I would mention the statements made by the beloved Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, with whom we share the hope of full ecclesial communion. 8. Patriarch Bartholomew has spoken in particular of the need for each of us to repent of the ways we have harmed the planet, for “inasmuch as we all generate small ecological damage”, we are called to acknowledge “our contribution, smaller or greater, to the disfigurement and destruction of creation”.[14] He has repeatedly stated this firmly and persuasively, challenging us to acknowledge our sins against creation: “For human beings… to destroy the biological diversity of God’s creation; for human beings to degrade the integrity of the earth by causing changes in its climate, by stripping the earth of its natural forests or destroying its wetlands; for human beings to contaminate the earth’s waters, its land, its air, and its life – these are sins”.[15] For “to commit a crime against the natural world is a sin against ourselves and a sin against God”.[16] 9. At the same time, Bartholomew has drawn attention to the ethical and spiritual roots of environmental problems, which require that we look for solutions not only in technology but in a change of humanity; otherwise we would be dealing merely with symptoms. He asks us to replace consumption with sacrifice, greed with generosity, wastefulness with a spirit of sharing, an asceticism which “entails learning to give, and not simply to give up. It is a way of loving, of moving gradually away from what I want to what God’s world needs. It is liberation from fear, greed and compulsion”.[17] As Christians, we are also called “to accept the world as a sacrament of communion, as a way of sharing with God and our neighbours on a global scale. It is our humble conviction that the divine and the human meet in the slightest detail in the seamless garment of God’s creation, in the last speck of dust of our planet”.[18] Saint Francis of Assisi 10. I do not want to write this Encyclical without turning to that attractive and compelling figure, whose name I took as my guide and inspiration when I was elected Bishop of Rome. I believe that Saint Francis is the example par excellence of care for the vulnerable and of an integral ecology lived out joyfully and authentically. He is the patron saint of all who study and work in the area of ecology, and he is also much loved by non-Christians. He was particularly concerned for God’s creation and for the poor and outcast. He loved, and was deeply loved for his joy, his generous self-giving, his openheartedness. He was a mystic and a pilgrim who lived in simplicity and in wonderful harmony with God, with others, with nature and with himself. He shows us just how inseparable the bond is between concern for nature, justice for the poor, commitment to society, and interior peace. 11. Francis helps us to see that an integral ecology calls for openness to categories which transcend the language of mathematics and biology, and take us to the heart of what it is to be human. Just as happens when we fall in love with someone, whenever he would gaze at the sun, the moon or the smallest of animals, he burst into song, drawing all other creatures into his praise. He communed with all creation, even preaching to the flowers, inviting them “to praise the Lord, just as if they were endowed with reason”.[19] His response to the world around him was so much more than intellectual appreciation or economic calculus, for to him each and every creature was a sister united to him by bonds of affection. That is why he felt called to care for all that exists. His disciple Saint Bonaventure tells us that, “from a reflection on the primary source of all things, filled with even more abundant piety, he would call creatures, no matter how small, by the name of ‘brother’ or ‘sister’”.[20] Such a conviction cannot be written off as naive romanticism, for it affects the choices which determine our behaviour. If we approach nature and the environment without this openness to awe and wonder, if we no longer speak the language of fraternity and beauty in our relationship with the world, our attitude will be that of masters, consumers, ruthless exploiters, unable to set limits on their immediate needs. By contrast, if we feel intimately united with all that exists, then sobriety and care will well up spontaneously. The poverty and austerity of Saint Francis were no mere veneer of asceticism, but something much more radical: a refusal to turn reality into an object simply to be used and controlled. 12. What is more, Saint Francis, faithful to Scripture, invites us to see nature as a magnificent book in which God speaks to us and grants us a glimpse of his infinite beauty and goodness. “Through the greatness and the beauty of creatures one comes to know by analogy their maker” (Wis 13:5); indeed, “his eternal power and divinity have been made known through his works since the creation of the world” (Rom 1:20). For this reason, Francis asked that part of the friary garden always be left untouched, so that wild flowers and herbs could grow there, and those who saw them could raise their minds to God, the Creator of such beauty.[21] Rather than a problem to be solved, the world is a joyful mystery to be contemplated with gladness and praise. My appeal 13. The urgent challenge to protect our common home includes a concern to bring the whole human family together to seek a sustainable and integral development, for we know that things can change. The Creator does not abandon us; he never forsakes his loving plan or repents of having created us. Humanity still has the ability to work together in building our common home. Here I want to recognize, encourage and thank all those striving in countless ways to guarantee the protection of the home which we share. Particular appreciation is owed to those who tirelessly seek to resolve the tragic effects of environmental degradation on the lives of the world’s poorest. Young people demand change. They wonder how anyone can claim to be building a better future without thinking of the environmental crisis and the sufferings of the excluded. 14. I urgently appeal, then, for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet. We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all. The worldwide ecological movement has already made considerable progress and led to the establishment of numerous organizations committed to raising awareness of these challenges. Regrettably, many efforts to seek concrete solutions to the environmental crisis have proved ineffective, not only because of powerful opposition but also because of a more general lack of interest. Obstructionist attitudes, even on the part of believers, can range from denial of the problem to indifference, nonchalant resignation or blind confidence in technical solutions. We require a new and universal solidarity. As the bishops of Southern Africa have stated: “Everyone’s talents and involvement are needed to redress the damage caused by human abuse of God’s creation”. [22] All of us can cooperate as instruments of God for the care of creation, each according to his or her own culture, experience, involvements and talents. 15. It is my hope that this Encyclical Letter, which is now added to the body of the Church’s social teaching, can help us to acknowledge the appeal, immensity and urgency of the challenge we face. I will begin by briefly reviewing several aspects of the present ecological crisis, with the aim of drawing on the results of the best scientific research available today, letting them touch us deeply and provide a concrete foundation for the ethical and spiritual itinerary that follows. I will then consider some principles drawn from the Judaeo-Christian tradition which can render our commitment to the environment more coherent. I will then attempt to get to the roots of the present situation, so as to consider not only its symptoms but also its deepest causes. This will help to provide an approach to ecology which respects our unique place as human beings in this world and our relationship to our surroundings. In light of this reflection, I will advance some broader proposals for dialogue and action which would involve each of us as individuals, and also affect international policy. Finally, convinced as I am that change is impossible without motivation and a process of education, I will offer some inspired guidelines for human development to be found in the treasure of Christian spiritual experience. 16. Although each chapter will have its own subject and specific approach, it will also take up and re-examine important questions previously dealt with. This is particularly the case with a number of themes which will reappear as the Encyclical unfolds. As examples, I will point to the intimate relationship between the poor and the fragility of the planet, the conviction that everything in the world is connected, the critique of new paradigms and forms of power derived from technology, the call to seek other ways of understanding the economy and progress, the value proper to each creature, the human meaning of ecology, the need for forthright and honest debate, the serious responsibility of international and local policy, the throwaway culture and the proposal of a new lifestyle. These questions will not be dealt with once and for all, but reframed and enriched again and again. CHAPTER ONE WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR COMMON HOME 17. Theological and philosophical reflections on the situation of humanity and the world can sound tiresome and abstract, unless they are grounded in a fresh analysis of our present situation, which is in many ways unprecedented in the history of humanity. So, before considering how faith brings new incentives and requirements with regard to the world of which we are a part, I will briefly turn to what is happening to our common home. 18. The continued acceleration of changes affecting humanity and the planet is coupled today with a more intensified pace of life and work which might be called “rapidification”. Although change is part of the working of complex systems, the speed with which human activity has developed contrasts with the naturally slow pace of biological evolution. Moreover, the goals of this rapid and constant change are not necessarily geared to the common good or to integral and sustainable human development. Change is something desirable, yet it becomes a source of anxiety when it causes harm to the world and to the quality of life of much of humanity. 19. Following a period of irrational confidence in progress and human abilities, some sectors of society are now adopting a more critical approach. We see increasing sensitivity to the environment and the need to protect nature, along with a growing concern, both genuine and distressing, for what is happening to our planet. Let us review, however cursorily, those questions which are troubling us today and which we can no longer sweep under the carpet. Our goal is not to amass information or to satisfy curiosity, but rather to become painfully aware, to dare to turn what is happening to the world into our own personal suffering and thus to discover what each of us can do about it. I. POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE Pollution, waste and the throwaway culture 20. Some forms of pollution are part of people’s daily experience. Exposure to atmospheric pollutants produces a broad spectrum of health hazards, especially for the poor, and causes millions of premature deaths. People take sick, for example, from breathing high levels of smoke from fuels used in cooking or heating. There is also pollution that affects everyone, caused by transport, industrial fumes, substances which contribute to the acidification of soil and water, fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides and agrotoxins in general. Technology, which, linked to business interests, is presented as the only way of solving these problems, in fact proves incapable of seeing the mysterious network of relations between things and so sometimes solves one problem only to create others. 21. Account must also be taken of the pollution produced by residue, including dangerous waste present in different areas. Each year hundreds of millions of tons of waste are generated, much of it non-biodegradable, highly toxic and radioactive, from homes and businesses, from construction and demolition sites, from clinical, electronic and industrial sources. The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth. In many parts of the planet, the elderly lament that once beautiful landscapes are now covered with rubbish. Industrial waste and chemical products utilized in cities and agricultural areas can lead to bioaccumulation in the organisms of the local population, even when levels of toxins in those places are low. Frequently no measures are taken until after people’s health has been irreversibly affected. 22. These problems are closely linked to a throwaway culture which affects the excluded just as it quickly reduces things to rubbish. To cite one example, most of the paper we produce is thrown away and not recycled. It is hard for us to accept that the way natural ecosystems work is exemplary: plants synthesize nutrients which feed herbivores; these in turn become food for carnivores, which produce significant quantities of organic waste which give rise to new generations of plants. But our industrial system, at the end of its cycle of production and consumption, has not developed the capacity to absorb and reuse waste and by-products. We have not yet managed to adopt a circular model of production capable of preserving resources for present and future generations, while limiting as much as possible the use of non-renewable resources, moderating their consumption, maximizing their efficient use, reusing and recycling them. A serious consideration of this issue would be one way of counteracting the throwaway culture which affects the entire planet, but it must be said that only limited progress has been made in this regard. Climate as a common good 23. The climate is a common good, belonging to all and meant for all. At the global level, it is a complex system linked to many of the essential conditions for human life. A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system. In recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon. Humanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it. It is true that there are other factors (such as volcanic activity, variations in the earth’s orbit and axis, the solar cycle), yet a number of scientific studies indicate that most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly as a result of human activity. As these gases build up in the atmosphere, they hamper the escape of heat produced by sunlight at the earth’s surface. The problem is aggravated by a model of development based on the intensive use of fossil fuels, which is at the heart of the worldwide energy system. Another determining factor has been an increase in changed uses of the soil, principally deforestation for agricultural purposes. 24. Warming has effects on the carbon cycle. It creates a vicious circle which aggravates the situation even more, affecting the availability of essential resources like drinking water, energy and agricultural production in warmer regions, and leading to the extinction of part of the planet’s biodiversity. The melting in the polar ice caps and in high altitude plains can lead to the dangerous release of methane gas, while the decomposition of frozen organic material can further increase the emission of carbon dioxide. Things are made worse by the loss of tropical forests which would otherwise help to mitigate climate change. Carbon dioxide pollution increases the acidification of the oceans and compromises the marine food chain. If present trends continue, this century may well witness extraordinary climate change and an unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequences for all of us. A rise in the sea level, for example, can create extremely serious situations, if we consider that a quarter of the world’s population lives on the coast or nearby, and that the majority of our megacities are situated in coastal areas. 25. Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day. Its worst impact will probably be felt by developing countries in coming decades. Many of the poor live in areas particularly affected by phenomena related to warming, and their means of subsistence are largely dependent on natural reserves and ecosystemic services such as agriculture, fishing and forestry. They have no other financial activities or resources which can enable them to adapt to climate change or to face natural disasters, and their access to social services and protection is very limited. For example, changes in climate, to which animals and plants cannot adapt, lead them to migrate; this in turn affects the livelihood of the poor, who are then forced to leave their homes, with great uncertainty for their future and that of their children. There has been a tragic rise in the number of migrants seeking to flee from the growing poverty caused by environmental degradation. They are not recognized by international conventions as refugees; they bear the loss of the lives they have left behind, without enjoying any legal protection whatsoever. Sadly, there is widespread indifference to such suffering, which is even now taking place throughout our world. Our lack of response to these tragedies involving our brothers and sisters points to the loss of that sense of responsibility for our fellow men and women upon which all civil society is founded. 26. Many of those who possess more resources and economic or political power seem mostly to be concerned with masking the problems or concealing their symptoms, simply making efforts to reduce some of the negative impacts of climate change. However, many of these symptoms indicate that such effects will continue to worsen if we continue with current models of production and consumption. There is an urgent need to develop policies so that, in the next few years, the emission of carbon dioxide and other highly polluting gases can be drastically reduced, for example, substituting for fossil fuels and developing sources of renewable energy. Worldwide there is minimal access to clean and renewable energy. There is still a need to develop adequate storage technologies. Some countries have made considerable progress, although it is far from constituting a significant proportion. Investments have also been made in means of production and transportation which consume less energy and require fewer raw materials, as well as in methods of construction and renovating buildings which improve their energy efficiency. But these good practices are still far from widespread. II. THE ISSUE OF WATER 27. Other indicators of the present situation have to do with the depletion of natural resources. We all know that it is not possible to sustain the present level of consumption in developed countries and wealthier sectors of society, where the habit of wasting and discarding has reached unprecedented levels. The exploitation of the planet has already exceeded acceptable limits and we still have not solved the problem of poverty. 28. Fresh drinking water is an issue of primary importance, since it is indispensable for human life and for supporting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Sources of fresh water are necessary for health care, agriculture and industry. Water supplies used to be relatively constant, but now in many places demand exceeds the sustainable supply, with dramatic consequences in the short and long term. Large cities dependent on significant supplies of water have experienced periods of shortage, and at critical moments these have not always been administered with sufficient oversight and impartiality. Water poverty especially affects Africa where large sectors of the population have no access to safe drinking water or experience droughts which impede agricultural production. Some countries have areas rich in water while others endure drastic scarcity. 29. One particularly serious problem is the quality of water available to the poor. Every day, unsafe water results in many deaths and the spread of water-related diseases, including those caused by microorganisms and chemical substances. Dysentery and cholera, linked to inadequate hygiene and water supplies, are a significant cause of suffering and of infant mortality. Underground water sources in many places are threatened by the pollution produced in certain mining, farming and industrial activities, especially in countries lacking adequate regulation or controls. It is not only a question of industrial waste. Detergents and chemical products, commonly used in many places of the world, continue to pour into our rivers, lakes and seas. 30. Even as the quality of available water is constantly diminishing, in some places there is a growing tendency, despite its scarcity, to privatize this resource, turning it into a commodity subject to the laws of the market. Yet access to safe drinkable water is a basic and universal human right, since it is essential to human survival and, as such, is a condition for the exercise of other human rights. Our world has a grave social debt towards the poor who lack access to drinking water, because they are denied the right to a life consistent with their inalienable dignity. This debt can be paid partly by an increase in funding to provide clean water and sanitary services among the poor. But water continues to be wasted, not only in the developed world but also in developing countries which possess it in abundance. This shows that the problem of water is partly an educational and cultural issue, since there is little awareness of the seriousness of such behaviour within a context of great inequality. 31. Greater scarcity of water will lead to an increase in the cost of food and the various products which depend on its use. Some studies warn that an acute water shortage may occur within a few decades unless urgent action is taken. The environmental repercussions could affect billions of people; it is also conceivable that the control of water by large multinational businesses may become a major source of conflict in this century.[23] III. LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY 32. The earth’s resources are also being plundered because of short-sighted approaches to the economy, commerce and production. The loss of forests and woodlands entails the loss of species which may constitute extremely important resources in the future, not only for food but also for curing disease and other uses. Different species contain genes which could be key resources in years ahead for meeting human needs and regulating environmental problems. 33. It is not enough, however, to think of different species merely as potential “resources” to be exploited, while overlooking the fact that they have value in themselves. Each year sees the disappearance of thousands of plant and animal species which we will never know, which our children will never see, because they have been lost for ever. The great majority become extinct for reasons related to human activity. Because of us, thousands of species will no longer give glory to God by their very existence, nor convey their message to us. We have no such right. 34. It may well disturb us to learn of the extinction of mammals or birds, since they are more visible. But the good functioning of ecosystems also requires fungi, algae, worms, insects, reptiles and an innumerable variety of microorganisms. Some less numerous species, although generally unseen, nonetheless play a critical role in maintaining the equilibrium of a particular place. Human beings must intervene when a geosystem reaches a critical state. But nowadays, such intervention in nature has become more and more frequent. As a consequence, serious problems arise, leading to further interventions; human activity becomes ubiquitous, with all the risks which this entails. Often a vicious circle results, as human intervention to resolve a problem further aggravates the situation. For example, many birds and insects which disappear due to synthetic agrotoxins are helpful for agriculture: their disappearance will have to be compensated for by yet other techniques which may well prove harmful. We must be grateful for the praiseworthy efforts being made by scientists and engineers dedicated to finding solutions to man-made problems. But a sober look at our world shows that the degree of human intervention, often in the service of business interests and consumerism, is actually making our earth less rich and beautiful, ever more limited and grey, even as technological advances and consumer goods continue to abound limitlessly. We seem to think that we can substitute an irreplaceable and irretrievable beauty with something which we have created ourselves. 35. In assessing the environmental impact of any project, concern is usually shown for its effects on soil, water and air, yet few careful studies are made of its impact on biodiversity, as if the loss of species or animals and plant groups were of little importance. Highways, new plantations, the fencing-off of certain areas, the damming of water sources, and similar developments, crowd out natural habitats and, at times, break them up in such a way that animal populations can no longer migrate or roam freely. As a result, some species face extinction. Alternatives exist which at least lessen the impact of these projects, like the creation of biological corridors, but few countries demonstrate such concern and foresight. Frequently, when certain species are exploited commercially, little attention is paid to studying their reproductive patterns in order to prevent their depletion and the consequent imbalance of the ecosystem. 36. Caring for ecosystems demands far-sightedness, since no one looking for quick and easy profit is truly interested in their preservation. But the cost of the damage caused by such selfish lack of con",truth
abc078e6,"How a Melting Arctic Changes Everything Part I: The Bare Arctic Eight countries control land in the Arctic Circle. Five have coastlines to defend. The temperature is rising. The ice is melting. The race for newly accessible resources is beginning. And Russia is gaining ground. The story of the Arctic begins with temperature but it’s so much more—this is a tale about oil and economics, about humanity and science, about politics and borders and the emerging risk of an emboldened and growing Russian empire. Arctic glaciers, such as this one in Russia’s Novaya Zemlya archipelago, have captured the attention of scientists who are trying to understand how they melt and flow. Photo: DigitalGlobe via Getty Images The world as a whole has warmed about 0.9 degrees Celsius (1.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1880. Arctic temperatures have risen twice that amount during the same time period. The most recent year analyzed, October 2015 to September 2016, was 3.5C warmer than the early 1900s, according to the 2016 Arctic Report Card. Northern Canada, Svalbard, Norway and Russia’s Kara Sea reached an astounding 14C (25F) higher than normal last fall. Scientists refer to these dramatic physical changes as “Arctic amplification,” or positive feedback loops. It’s a little bit like compound interest. A small change snowballs, and Arctic conditions become much less Arctic, much more quickly. “After studying the Arctic and its climate for three-and-a-half decades,” Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data center, wrote recently. “I have concluded that what has happened over the last year goes beyond even the extreme.” Change in Average Annual Temperatures Source: Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia The heat is making quick work of its natural prey: ice. Scientists track the number of “freezing-degree days,” a running seasonal tally of the amount of time it’s been cold enough for water to freeze. The 2016-2017 winter season has seen a dramatic shortfall in coldness—more than 20 percent below the average, a record.

Photographer: Mario Tama/Getty Images Sea ice has diminished much faster than scientists and climate models anticipated. Last month set a new low for March, out-melting 2015 by 23,000 square miles. Compared with the 1981-2010 baseline, the average September sea-ice minimum has been dropping by more than 13 percent per decade. A recent study in Nature Climate Change estimated that from 30-50 percent of sea ice loss is due to climate variability, while the rest occurs because of human activity. Receding ice decreases the Earth’s overall reflectivity, making the Arctic darker and therefore absorbing even more heat. Total Area of Arctic Sea Ice Weekly data in square kilometers 197820162017 0 5 10 20K Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Source: NASA NSIDC - Sea Ice Index The ice is not all the same age or thickness, although it has become somewhat more uniform. In 1985, about 45 percent of Arctic sea ice was made up of older and thicker multi-year ice. By 2016, that number shrank to 22 percent. With a greater percentage of seasonal ice, which disappears each Arctic summer, nations of the north have more time and opportunity to explore the resources beneath and within their territorial waters. The sea-ice loss is President Vladimir Putin’s gain. Already the largest country on the planet, Russia stands to gain access to shipping routes and energy reserves, and a strategic military advantage from the opening of the Arctic. Along the Russian coastline, which makes up more than half the Arctic total, winds and currents push old ice away from potential shipping lanes and prevent the build-up of thicker, multi-year ice that would leave other parts of the Arctic impassable for longer periods. That dynamic helps bring the Northern Sea Route—shippers’ hoped-for Russian express between Western Europe and East Asia—closer to fruition.

Pictured here is the Tracy Arm Fjord, a popular tourism destination near Juneau. Photographer: Paulo Costa/Getty Images Sea ice, by definition, is already in the water and therefore doesn't add to rising ocean levels as it dissolves. The same logic does not apply to Greenland’s melting glaciers and ice sheets. Last year, Greenland saw the second-largest melt on record. The hot season lasted a troubling 30 to 40 days longer than usual in the northeast portion of the region. There's enough water locked up in Greenland’s ice sheet to raise seas worldwide by 20 feet. While it may take centuries to fully melt, scientists are concerned that we have a limited time to act to prevent the climate from locking in the ice sheet’s demise.

Named for its distinctive hue, this ice is so thin that sunlight shines through, allowing phytoplankton to thrive. Vegetation growth in parts of Canadian and Russian Arctic waters has boomed to from 5 and 19 percent above the 2003-2015 average, according to NOAA. What the change means for delicate ecosystems and fish stocks is the subject of increasing research attention. In a presentation in November, Johan Rockström, environmental scientist and director of the Stockholm Resilience Center, reached for scientific euphemism to make manageable the enormous scale of these interlocking changes—and who needs to be thinking about them: “Canada, Russia and parts of the U.S. seem to be the Arctic nations subject to the largest, let’s say, set of diverse regime-shift risks. In the long run, every part of the Arctic food web may have to adjust to the warming atmosphere’s byproduct: altered ocean chemistry. Oceans do humanity a huge favor by absorbing some atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, when CO2 dissolves into water, it becomes a weak acid that, as it accumulates, may strain ecosystems that have evolved for today’s slightly alkaline waters. The change is happening globally, but cold water “acidifies” more quickly than warmer seas. Arctic land stores about twice as much carbon as the atmosphere. While growing seasons—which are now either longer or newly possible, depending on the exact location—suck in carbon dioxide during the spring and summer, scientists believe the thawing lands are now emitting more carbon than they take in.

Warming temperatures have accelerated the rate of natural underground methane leaks. The gas builds up in the soil, forming mounds called “pingoes.” When the pressure becomes too great, the ground explodes, leaving 30 to 40-meter-wide craters. Seismologists have begun to install sensors in the Russian Arctic to give advance notice of fields ready to blow their top. These local events are a powerful visual example of how the world is changing in dramatic and surprising ways. This crater was created by the explosion of a “pingo,” a pocket of methane gas on Russia’s Yamal Peninsula, in northern Siberian. Warming ground temperatures are causing pingoes to pop with greater frequency.

03ed5214,"Climate: 9 questions on rising seas You’ve probably heard about some of the impacts of rising seas: Nearly a fifth of Bangladesh, in South Asia, could be submerged; some low-lying islands in the Pacific may disappear; coastal cities like Miami and New York are expected to see more floods. But exactly how and why are the seas rising? The underlying answer, of course, is that humans are warming the planet by burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests and engaging in other activities that release heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. Policy makers have concluded that the warming would be especially dangerous if it crosses a threshold of 2 degrees Celsius higher than Earth’s temperature at the start of the industrial revolution. But for details on how climate change is raising the height of the ocean, I turned to CNN International meteorologist and supervising weather producer Brandon Miller. I’ll be exploring sea-level rise and what happens to people whose homes are flooded this month as part of CNN’s “2 degrees” series on climate change. Let me know in the comments at the bottom of this post if there are other sea-level-related questions you’d like to see answered. And consider signing up for the “2 degrees” newsletter if you’d like to follow along. 1. Why are sea levels rising? Global sea level rise occurs because of two factors. The biggest reason is because of something called “thermal expansion,” which is simply that water expands as it warms, just like how the liquid in a thermometer expands as the temperature increases. Therefore, as global temperatures continue to rise, the oceans get warmer and they literally expand, making the level of the sea rise. The other main contributor to sea level rise is the loss of glaciers and the polar ice caps. When the glaciers and ice caps melt, that water flows into the ocean and increases its volume. 2. Is this already happening – or is it a future thing? Yes it is already happening, and yes it will continue to happen in the future, with the rate of sea level rise likely increasing as well. Since 1900 we have seen seas rise, on average, about 20 cm (8 inches). While ocean levels varied over the past 2,000 years, they did so much more slowly. It would have taken several hundred years to change the ocean level by the amount we have witnessed over the past century, with a bulk of that increase coming in the last 25 years. The rate of change in the past 20 years is about double the rate of change over the past 100 years, indicating that the rate of sea level rise is increasing. 3. What will happen to sea levels if the climate warms 2 degrees? Sea levels will certainly continue to rise if the climate warms 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). Sea level rise will not stop, even if the warming ends at 2 degrees. Instead, it will continue for many centuries due to the lag in response times of the world’s oceans and massive ice sheets. If we look at the distant past, 120,000 years ago, when only very early humans existed, the temperature was 2 degrees warmer than it is now. Sea levels were about 5 meters (16 feet) higher than they are today. Nearly 500 million people worldwide currently live below 5 meters elevation. 4. How much are sea levels expected to rise by, say, 2100? According to the latest projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a 2 degree increase in temperature by the end of this century would result in about a half a meter (1.5 feet) of sea level rise. If we drastically and immediately reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses we are currently emitting, the sea level will still continue to rise as the result of the warming we have already seen, but it should be less, likely around 40 cm (15 inches). If we continue increasing greenhouse gas emissions at the current rate, the increase in sea level could be up to double that amount, or 80 cm (31 inches) by 2100. 5. What about in the really, really long term? One of the big questions is how much warming will it take to melt the Greenland Ice Sheet, which contains enough water to raise sea levels by 7 meters (23 feet). This is an incredibly difficult question to answer, but current research shows it is likely between 1 degree and 4 degrees warming, compared to pre-industrial averages. If 2 degrees is enough to melt the Greenland Ice Sheet, for instance, it could mean sea levels would rise much higher and faster than current projections show. A total melting of Greenland’s ice likely would take thousands of years, though. 6. Are lots of the Pacific islands actually going to disappear? Likely not disappear, at least not in the short term (through the end of this century), but they will be dramatically impacted. Many low-lying regions will see drastic changes to their coastal geography from beach erosion, significant infrastructure challenges from things like saltwater intrusion into the water system, and population displacement from inundation. There are some extreme examples, such as the Marshall Islands, where 99% of the country lies below 5 meters in elevation, which could literally be “wiped off the map,” but the problem is far more wide-reaching than a few tiny Pacific islands. Coastal communities around the world will face higher risks for storm-induced tidal surges, frequent inundation from high tides, etc. Many of the world’s largest and most influential cities are located on the coast and must make significant preparations to combat rising sea levels. 7. What about Bangladesh? Isn’t it very high risk? Yes, absolutely. Bangladesh is in a very precarious situation in that it is vulnerable to flooding from all sides as a result of climate change. Increasing sea levels will continuously shrink the low-level coastal communities, while the major rivers that flow through Bangladesh (Ganges and Brahmaputra) will face increasing water levels from melting glaciers in the Himalayas. Bangladesh has the eighth largest population of any country – at 158 million – and a majority of these people live in the areas where these rising rivers meet a rising sea. 8. What’s happening to U.S. cities – like New York, NOLA and Miami? The World Bank recently led a study that ranked cities around the globe in terms of their risk of coastal flooding resulting from climate change. When looking at overall costs of damage, five of the top 10 cities were in the United States: Miami (2), New York (3), New Orleans (4), Tampa (7), Boston (8). This is largely due to the massive amounts of infrastructure, economic assets and population that are located directly on the coast and at low elevation. Based on the 2014 U.S. National Climate Assessment, New York City would see a local sea level rise of nearly 4 feet by 2100. A 4-foot sea level rise for New York would result in nearly 100,000 people being underwater in New York City alone, with a property value of $16.5 billion. 9. How many people will be displaced by rising seas? In a 2-degree world, hundreds of millions of people will be affected by coastal flooding as a result of climate change. Asia, namely East, Southeast, and South Asia will be particularly affected. Unfortunately, some of these regions which will face the largest and most immediate impacts from rising seas have the fewest resources to combat them. In many cases, the cost of coastal adaptation may be too much, flooding from storms pushing higher water levels into homes will become too frequent, or the intrusion of saltwater into the local water table will make growing crops impossible – and people in all regions of the world will be forced to leave their homes and cities.",truth
8695b2a9,"Did Climate Change Intensify Hurricane Harvey? “The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm.” Hurricane Harvey looms off the coast of Texas, as seen from aboard the International Space Station. Every so often, the worst-case scenario comes to pass. As of Sunday afternoon, the remnants of Hurricane Harvey seem likely to exceed the worst forecasts that preceded the storm. The entire Houston metropolitan region is flooding: Interstates are under feet of water, local authorities have asked boat owners to join rescue efforts, and most of the streams and rivers near the city are in flood stage. Some models suggest that the storm will linger over the area until Wednesday night, dumping 50 inches of water in total on Houston and the surrounding area. “Local rainfall amounts of 50 inches would exceed any previous Texas rainfall record. The breadth and intensity of this rainfall are beyond anything experienced before,” said a statement from the National Weather Service. “Catastrophic flooding is now underway and expected to continue for several days.” (In years of weather reporting, I have never seen a statement this blunt and ominous.) This means that thousands of people—and perhaps tens of thousands of people—are facing a terrifying and all-too-real struggle to survive right now. In an age when the climate is changing rapidly, a natural question to ask is: What role did human-caused global warming play in strengthening this storm? Climate scientists, who specialize in thinking about the Earth system as a whole, are often reticent to link any one weather event to global climate change. But they say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey—and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide—suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse. It may not be obvious why global warming has anything to do with hurricane strength. Climate change is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases prevent some of the sun’s rays from bouncing back into space, trapping heat in the planetary system and raising air temperatures all over the world. This warmer air causes evaporation to happen faster, which can lead to more moisture in the atmosphere. But that phenomenon alone does not explain climate change’s effects on Harvey. Storms like Harvey are helped by one of the consequences of climate change: As the air warms, some of that heat is absorbed by the ocean, which in turn raises the temperature of the sea’s upper layers. Harvey benefited from unusually toasty waters in the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm roared toward Houston last week, sea-surface waters near Texas rose to between 2.7 and 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit above average. These waters were some of the hottest spots of ocean surface in the world. The tropical storm, feeding off this unusual warmth, was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours. “This is the main fuel for the storm,” says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research. “Although these storms occur naturally, the storm is apt to be more intense, maybe a bit bigger, longer-lasting, and with much heavier rainfalls [because of that ocean heat].” This also suggests an explanation for one of Harvey’s strangest and scariest behaviors. The storm intensified up until the moment of landfall, achieving category-four strength hours before it slammed into the Texas coast. This is not only rare for tropical cyclones in the western Gulf of Mexico: It may be unique. In the past 30 years of records, no storms west of Florida have intensified in the last 12 hours before landfall. Why do storms normally weaken—and why didn’t Harvey? As mentioned above, hurricanes feed and grow on warm ocean surface waters. But as they grow, their strong winds often pick up seawater, churning the oceans and moving the warmest waters deep below the surface. The same winds also bring newer, colder water closer to the atmosphere, which usually serves to drain energy and weaken the storm. That didn’t happen with Harvey. The hurricane churned up water 100 or even 200 meters below the surface, said Trenberth, but this water was still warm—meaning that the storm could keep growing and strengthening. “Harvey was not in a good position to intensify the way it did, because it was so close to land. It’s amazing it was able to do that,” he told me. All of this said, a storm like Harvey could have happened even if there was no climate change. Planning experts have long fretted over the possibility of a major hurricane striking Houston. Harvey is also a powerful hurricane forming in one of the most hurricane-friendly regions of the world at the peak of hurricane season. Storms similar to it would form in any climate. But Trenberth says that the extra heat could make the storm more costly and more powerful, overpowering and eventually breaking local drainage systems. “The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm,” he said. “It may have been a strong storm, and it may have caused a lot of problems anyway—but [human-caused climate change] amplifies the damage considerably.” More generally, it’s still unclear what effect climate change is having on hurricane formation across the greater Atlantic Ocean. A draft version of a major U.S. government review of climate science due out later this year says there is “medium confidence” that human activities “have contributed to the observed upward trend in North Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s.” Houston has been ground zero for super-damaging storms lately. It has seen four 100-year flooding events since the spring of 2015, according to the meteorologist Eric Holthaus. The city also sees 167 percent more heavy downpours than it did in the 1950s. Meanwhile, only one-sixth of its residents have federal flood insurance, though that program has struggled to adjust to the increased flooding risk associated with climate change. Yet even compared to recent storms, Harvey is unprecedented—just the kind of weird weather that scientists expect to see more of as the planet warms. Harvey has already dumped more water on Harris County than Tropical Storm Allison, the area’s previous worst-ever flooding disaster in 2001, though it has only lasted half the time of that earlier storm. And it will keep raining. As of Sunday afternoon, Buffalo Bayou, a major river near downtown Houston, is one foot above flood stage. It is projected to rise as much as another 12 feet today alone.",truth
dab821ac,"Scientists have just detected a major change to the Earth’s oceans linked to a warming climate A large research synthesis, published in one of the world’s most influential scientific journals, has detected a decline in the amount of dissolved oxygen in oceans around the world — a long-predicted result of climate change that could have severe consequences for marine organisms if it continues. The paper, published Wednesday in the journal Nature by oceanographer Sunke Schmidtko and two colleagues from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany, found a decline of more than 2 percent in ocean oxygen content worldwide between 1960 and 2010. The loss, however, showed up in some ocean basins more than others. The largest overall volume of oxygen was lost in the largest ocean — the Pacific — but as a percentage, the decline was sharpest in the Arctic Ocean, a region facing Earth’s most stark climate change. The loss of ocean oxygen “has been assumed from models, and there have been lots of regional analysis that have shown local decline, but it has never been shown on the global scale, and never for the deep ocean,” said Schmidtko, who conducted the research with Lothar Stramma and Martin Visbeck, also of GEOMAR. Ocean oxygen is vital to marine organisms, but also very delicate — unlike in the atmosphere, where gases mix together thoroughly, in the ocean that is far harder to accomplish, Schmidtko explained. Moreover, he added, just 1 percent of all the Earth’s available oxygen mixes into the ocean; the vast majority remains in the air. Climate change models predict the oceans will lose oxygen because of several factors. Most obvious is simply that warmer water holds less dissolved gases, including oxygen. “It’s the same reason we keep our sparkling drinks pretty cold,” Schmidtko said. But another factor is the growing stratification of ocean waters. Oxygen enters the ocean at its surface, from the atmosphere and from the photosynthetic activity of marine microorganisms. But as that upper layer warms up, the oxygen-rich waters are less likely to mix down into cooler layers of the ocean because the warm waters are less dense and do not sink as readily. “When the upper ocean warms, less water gets down deep, and so therefore, the oxygen supply to the deep ocean is shut down or significantly reduced,” Schmidtko said. The new study represents a synthesis of literally “millions” of separate ocean measurements over time, according to GEOMAR. The authors then used interpolation techniques for areas of the ocean where they lacked measurements. The resulting study attributes less than 15 percent of the total oxygen loss to sheer warmer temperatures, which create less solubility. The rest was attributed to other factors, such as a lack of mixing. Matthew Long, an oceanographer from the National Center for Atmospheric Research who has published on ocean oxygen loss, said he considers the new results “robust” and a “major advance in synthesizing observations to examine oxygen trends on a global scale.” Long was not involved in the current work, but his research had previously demonstrated that ocean oxygen loss was expected to occur and that it should soon be possible to demonstrate that in the real world through measurements, despite the complexities involved in studying the global ocean and deducing trends about it. That’s just what the new study has done. “Natural variations have obscured our ability to definitively detect this signal in observations,” Long said in an email. “In this study, however, Schmidtko et al. synthesize all available observations to show a global-scale decline in oxygen that conforms to the patterns we expect from human-driven climate warming. They do not make a definitive attribution statement, but the data are consistent with and strongly suggestive of human-driven warming as a root cause of the oxygen decline. “It is alarming to see this signal begin to emerge clearly in the observational data,” he added. “Schmidtko and colleagues’ findings should ring yet more alarm bells about the consequences of global warming,” added Denis Gilbert, a researcher with the Maurice Lamontagne Institute at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Quebec, in an accompanying commentary on the study also published in Nature. Because oxygen in the global ocean is not evenly distributed, the 2 percent overall decline means there is a much larger decline in some areas of the ocean than others. Moreover, the ocean already contains so-called oxygen minimum zones, generally found in the middle depths. The great fear is that their expansion upward, into habitats where fish and other organism thrive, will reduce the available habitat for marine organisms. In shallower waters, meanwhile, the development of ocean “hypoxic” areas, or so-called “dead zones,” may also be influenced in part by declining oxygen content overall. On top of all of that, declining ocean oxygen can also worsen global warming in a feedback loop. In or near low oxygen areas of the oceans, microorganisms tend to produce nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas, Gilbert writes. Thus the new study “implies that production rates and efflux to the atmosphere of nitrous oxide … will probably have increased.” The new study underscores once again that some of the most profound consequences of climate change are occurring in the oceans, rather than on land. In recent years, incursions of warm ocean water have caused large die-offs of coral reefs, and in some cases, kelp forests as well. Meanwhile, warmer oceans have also begun to destabilize glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica, and as they melt, these glaciers freshen the ocean waters and potentially change the nature of their circulation. When it comes to ocean deoxygenation, as climate change continues, this trend should also increase — studies suggest a loss of up to 7 percent of the ocean’s oxygen by 2100. At the end of the current paper, the researchers are blunt about the consequences of a continuing loss of oceanic oxygen. “Far-reaching implications for marine ecosystems and fisheries can be expected,” they write",truth
6c88493a,"What science can tell us about the links between global warming and massive heat waves The United States is witnessing a massive, dangerous heat wave, as a huge system of high pressure covers the central part of the country. It’s a big enough deal that yesterday President Obama even tweeted about it, including a map showing the maximum heat index in some parts of the Midwest and Southeast reaching 110 or 115 degrees on Saturday. Here in Washington, temperatures could break 100 degrees Friday or over the weekend.   This will, inevitably, lead to much talk of climate change in the coming days. So it’s important to separate the scientific wheat from the chaff and figure out what science can, and can’t, reliably say about the link between an event like this and a warming planet — especially in a year that, on a global scale, has shattered past temperature records for six out of the last six months. And the gist is that when it comes to extreme heat waves in general — heat waves that appear out of the norm in some way, for instance in their intensity, frequency, or duration — while scientists never say individual events are “caused” by climate change, they are getting less and less circumspect about making some connection. “As predictable as the sunrise, some will say heat waves always happened,” said Marshall Shepherd, director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia and former president of the American Meteorological Society. “Yep, so did home runs in baseball, but the steroid era brought more and longer home runs. A new National Academies study suggests that ‘heat waves’ may be one of the primary climate change markers like home runs were in baseball.” In other words, when a planet warms, the odds shift in favor of more intense or long lasting heat waves. That’s just plain logic. Indeed, the National Academy of Sciences report in question notes that, “Confidence in attribution findings of anthropogenic influence is greatest for those extreme events that are related to an aspect of temperature, such as the observed long-term warming of the region or global climate, where there is little doubt that human activities have caused an observed change.” “In particular, for extreme heat and cold events, changes in long-term mean conditions provide a basis for expecting that there should also be changes in extreme conditions.” And we’ve definitely already had changes in not only “long-term mean conditions,” but in heat waves themselves. The U.S. National Climate Assessment found that U.S. heat waves have already “become more frequent and intense,” that the U.S. is shattering high temperature records far more frequently than it is shattering low temperature records (just as you’d expect), and that it is seeing correspondingly fewer cold spells. As for future projections, meanwhile, the assessment added that “Climate models project that the same summertime temperatures that ranked among the hottest 5% in 1950-1979 will occur at least 70% of the time by 2035-2064 in the U.S. if global emissions of heat-trapping gases continue to grow.” However, pointing all of this out is not the same as making a specific attribution for this specific heat event — rather, it is saying that attribution can be made for this class or type of event. Beyond that, specific attribution requires active research, and an attention to the actual temperatures, duration and other aspects of the weather phenomenon. That’s because, as Shepherd notes, there are always heat waves, even in a stable climate. Typically, in such an attribution study, scientists will use sets of climate models — one set including the factors that drive human global warming and the other including purely “natural” factors — and see if an event like the one in question is more likely to occur in the first set of models. Researchers are getting better and better at performing these kinds of studies fast, in near real time. So don’t be at all surprised if we see such a study for the current heat wave event — just as we saw for, most recently, the devastating bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, which was tied to an extreme marine heatwave off Australia’s northeastern coast. But in the meantime, some scientists and experts aren’t holding back. With every heat wave, probably the number one question is, is it climate change, or is it not? Well the answer is, it’s both,” said Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe on a press call Thursday. “We get heat waves naturally, but climate change is amping them up, it’s giving them that extra energy, to make them even more serious, and have even greater impacts.” Hayhoe didn’t attempt a specific attribution of the current heat wave, any more than Shepherd did. Rather, she’s once again articulating the general connection. “We are not used to having heat waves that are extreme as the ones we see today,” she said. It’s important to underscore, as Hayhoe did, that this event poses severe risks to health — particularly for children and the elderly — and also to crops across the U.S. heartland. She pointed to an extreme 2003 heat wave that affected Paris and Europe, and which has indeed been connected to climate change through statistical attribution analysis. That event killed hundreds of people in Paris and London, and a recent study attributed at least some of those deaths, themselves, to climate change. So these links are real, if not always simple to characterize. Now, it’s all about watching this current event carefully, taking preparations, and seeing what scientists have to say once they run their analyses.",truth
4b68af25,"The arctics carbon bomb might be even more potent than we thought For some time, scientists fearing the mass release of greenhouse gases from the carbon-rich, frozen soils of the Arctic have had at least one morsel of good news in their forecasts: They predicted most of the gas released would be carbon dioxide, which, though a greenhouse gas, drives warming more slowly than some other gases. Scientists obviously weren’t excited about more carbon dioxide emissions, but it was better than the alternative: methane, a shorter-lived but far harder-hitting gas that could cause faster bursts of warming. Now even that silver lining is in doubt. Research released Monday suggests that methane releases could be considerably more prevalent as Arctic permafrost thaws. The research finds that in waterlogged wetland soils, where oxygen is not prevalent, tiny microorganisms will produce a considerable volume of methane, a gas that doesn’t last in the air much more than a decade but has a warming effect many times that of carbon dioxide over a period of 100 years.  What we can definitely say is that the importance of methane was underestimated until now in the carbon studies,” said Christian Knobloch, a researcher at Universität Hamburg in Germany and the lead author of the study, published in Nature Climate Change. The divergent finding came after Knoblauch and his colleagues conducted a lengthy experiment, more than seven years long, monitoring patches of submerged and artificially warmed soil from Siberia in the laboratory, and gradually seeing sensitive methane-producing microorganisms become more prevalent over time. Knoblauch contends that other studies have not examined waterlogged Arctic soils for as long, and he notes that in some cases it took three years or more for the methane-generating microorganisms to really get cranking. “What we saw is that it takes a very long time until methane starts being produced, and the study that we did is really the first one which is so long,” Knoblauch said.The research was conducted along with colleagues from several institutions in Germany, Sweden and Russia. So much methane was produced in the experiment, the researchers calculated that the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from wet soils, or wetlands, will be higher than from drier soils, where carbon dioxide should indeed be the top gas released. This finding, if further confirmed, could reorient calculations of the overall potential of permafrost to worsen global warming over the coming century. For instance, one major study of the permafrost warming potential, published in 2015 in the journal Nature, played down the potential for methane release in wet soils, saying drier soils would be the bigger problem. “In spite of the more potent greenhouse gas CH4, a unit of newly thawed permafrost carbon could have a greater impact on climate over a century if it thaws and decomposes within a drier, aerobic soil as compared to an equivalent amount of carbon within a waterlogged soil or sediment,” that research found. The new study would appear to contradict this. But Knoblauch cautions that more research would have to be done to go from these results to a forecast for just how much methane could waft from permafrost in the coming decades. It will be important to know, for instance, how much thawed permafrost will be stuck in watery conditions vs. dry ones. One Arctic permafrost expert not involved in the research, Merritt Turetsky of the University of Guelph, praised the new study, noting that the researchers had spent a long time trying to uncover the behavior of tiny methane-producing organisms in watery soil. The research, she said, could help bridge the gap between field studies of waterlogged permafrost that have detected methane emissions and laboratory studies that have seemed to play down the importance of the gas. “What’s remarkable about this study is the length of time they spent tracking the communities, and I think that offers a potential reason for why field and lab studies have disagreed with each other,” Turetsky said. She said the total amount of permafrost carbon that could be vulnerable because of global warming during this century — perhaps 10 percent of it, which would be more than enough to undermine global climate goals — probably won’t change in light of the new research. But the fraction of that carbon that is emitted as methane, as opposed to carbon dioxide, will be crucial, she said, and remains to be determined. “We absolutely have to partition that total permafrost carbon release into those two forms, because it really matters,” Turetsky said. “So I think that has got to be where the community goes next.” But Róisín Commane, a research associate at Harvard who studies the Arctic atmosphere and also was not involved in this research, was more skeptical about relying on this study to assume a worse verdict about methane. The study was “very nicely done,” she said, but the tendency of wet soils to produce methane could be counteracted by several factors. The soils could also become host to organisms that devour that methane — and turn it into carbon dioxide. And, as the Arctic continues to warm, soils might not retain as much water, as the subsurface ice that held it in place gradually gives way, she noted. “How much of it makes it into the atmosphere is the big thing,” Commane said. “Ecosystems will probably produce more methane as they stay wet. The big question we have is, how much of that makes it into the atmosphere, and I don’t think they get to that question here.”",truth
34855333,"One of the most troubling ideas about climate change just found new evidence in its favor Ever since 2012, scientists have been debating a complex and frankly explosive idea about how a warming planet will alter our weather — one that, if it’s correct, would have profound implications across the Northern Hemisphere and especially in its middle latitudes, where hundreds of millions of people live. The idea is that climate change doesn’t merely increase the overall likelihood of heat waves, say, or the volume of rainfall — it also changes the flow of weather itself. By altering massive planet-scale air patterns like the jet stream (pictured above), which flows in waves from west to east in the Northern Hemisphere, a warming planet causes our weather to become more stuck in place. This means that a given weather pattern, whatever it may be, may persist for longer, thus driving extreme droughts, heat waves, downpours and more. This basic idea has sparked half a decade of criticism and debate, and at the cutting edge of research, scientists continue to grapple with it. And now, a new study once again reinforces one of its core aspects. ublishing in Nature Scientific Reports, Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University and a group of colleagues at research institutes in the United States, Germany and the Netherlands find that at least in the spring and summer, the large scale flow of the atmosphere is indeed changing in such a way as to cause weather to get stuck more often.  The study, its authors write, “adds to the weight of evidence for a human influence on the occurrence of devastating events such as the 2003 European heat wave, the 2010 Pakistan flood and Russian heat wave, the 2011 Texas heat wave and recent floods in Europe.” But what does it mean for global warming to alter the jet stream? The basic ideas at play here get complicated fast. The study itself, for instance, refers to “quasi-resonant amplification (QRA) of synoptic-scale waves” as the key mechanism for how researchers believe this is happening — terminology sure to impart terror in nonscientists worldwide.  On the other hand, some of this isn’t all that complicated. The Northern Hemisphere jet stream flows in a wavy pattern from west to east, driven by the rotation of the Earth and the difference in temperature between the equator and the North Pole. The flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large. But when the Arctic warms up faster than the equator does — which is part of the fundamental definition of global warming, and which is already happening — the jet stream’s flow can become weakened and elongated. That’s when you can get the resultant weather extremes. “It’s sort of like if you confine an electromagnetic wave to a coaxial cable, then you’re not losing energy, it’s being tightly contained in that cable and sent to your television,” said Mann. “These waves aren’t losing energy, so they grow and get larger and get stuck in place as well.” What the new study is saying is that in summer, in particular, this can occur. Moreover, it finds that a particular temperature pattern is linked to that behavior — and this temperature pattern, featuring an extra warm Arctic, is becoming more frequent over time, based on both observations and also a review of the outputs of high powered climate change models that the researchers conducted.  “We think that the signal has emerged from the noise over the last decade,” said Mann. One researcher who co-wrote an influential 2012 study suggesting that changes in the Arctic could be driving mid-latitude weather extremes, Stephen Vavrus of the University of Wisconsin, praised the new research in an emailed comment Monday. “This study goes beyond statistical correlations and explores a specific process that can plausibly explain how enhanced high-latitude warming trends may trigger remote weather impacts,” he said. But other scientific authors have expressed considerable skepticism of these kinds of ideas in the past. A recent study in Nature GeosciOne author of that study, John Fyfe of the Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and Analysis at Environment and Climate Change Canada, remarked of the Mann paper by email: “It is well established that there has been a human influence on the large-scale atmospheric circulation and temperature of the Northern Hemisphere. Mann et al. advance a theory that attempts to link those changes to changes in the spectrum of shorter-scale waves in the atmosphere, which are our weathermakers. I do not believe that this theory is fully developed or that the implications have been fully explored, but I do think that Mann et al.  study is a very good start.” The current study really only covers weather extremes in the spring and summer. For extremes occurring in winter, Mann said, we need to look to other mechanisms for odd atmospheric behavior. Nonetheless, the work represents yet another suggestion that a changing climate is leading to a changing pattern of atmospheric flow, with major implications for the weather felt by a massive swath of the global population. Mann, who testifies before Congress this week in a session that is expected to feature a rip-roaring debate about the severity of climate change, commented, “That’s going to be a fake debate. But this stuff is where the real debate is now.”ence, for instance, called into question whether the Arctic’s melting, and in particular its sea ice loss, has been causing winter cooling over Eurasia, another idea that has been swept up in the debate over the jet stream and weather extremes.",truth
093939cc,"About Those Non-Disappearing Pacific Islands Residents are leaving the Marshall Islands, but not because of climate change. Hype and exaggeration serve no one. Rangiroa atoll, lagoon and coral reefs from the air. Once a year or so, journalists from major news outlets travel to the Marshall Islands, a remote chain of volcanic islands and coral atolls in the Pacific Ocean, to report in panicked tones that the island nation is vanishing because of climate change. Their dispatches are often filled with raw emotion and suggest that residents are fleeing atolls swiftly sinking into the sea. Yet new research shows that this is not the entire—or even an accurate—picture. Acknowledging this doesn’t mean that global warming isn’t real, or that world leaders and scientists shouldn’t tackle the adverse effects of climate change, but hype and exaggeration serve no one. Using historic aerial photographs and high-resolution satellite imagery, Auckland University scientists Murray Ford and Paul Kench recently analyzed shoreline changes on six atolls and two mid-ocean reef islands in the Marshall Islands. Their peer-reviewed study, published in the September 2015 issue of Anthropocene, revealed that since the middle of the 20th century the total land area of the islands has actually grown. How is that possible? It seems self-evident that rising sea levels will reduce land area. However, there is a process of accretion, where coral broken up by the waves washes up on these low-lying islands as sand, counteracting the reduction in land mass. Research shows that this process is overpowering the erosion from sea-level rise, leading to net land-area gain. This is not only true for the Marshall Islands. The researchers write that within the “recently emerging body of shoreline change studies on atoll islands there is little evidence of widespread reef island erosion. To the contrary, several studies have documented noteworthy shoreline progradation [growth] and positional changes of islands since the mid-20th century, resulting in a net increase in island area.” The most famous of these studies, published in 2010 by Paul Kench and Arthur Webb of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission in Fiji, showed that of 27 Pacific islands, 14% lost area. Yet 43% gained area, with the rest remaining stable. Representatives from the Marshall Islands have been vocal about the need for strong global action on climate. President Hilda Heine has told reporters that longtime residents are leaving the Marshall Islands because climate change is threatening the nation’s existence. It’s true that approximately one-third of the population has relocated to the U.S.—but for reasons more mundane than climate change. Some 52.7% of the Marshall Islands population lives below the poverty line, according to the Asian Development Bank. Only 39.3% of the population age 15 years and above is employed. In its 2015 human-rights report on the island nation, the U.S. State Department said that significant problems include “chronic government corruption, and chronic domestic violence,” along with “child abuse, sex trafficking, and lack of legal provisions protecting worker’s rights.” Marshallese citizens also have an easy immigration pathway to America and can live, work and study in the U.S. without a visa. It is understandable why Marshall Island leaders might prefer to talk about global warming. But blaming today’s emigration on rising seas does a disservice to all. Telling viewers in the U.S. starkly that they’re “making this island disappear,” as a report from CNN’s John Sutter did in June 2015, makes for good, blame-laden television. But this reductionist, fact-averse rhetoric contributes to the idea that climate-change discussion should be a two-sided, cartoonish fight between those who say it is not real and those who say it is the worst problem facing humanity. Even more insidiously, doom-mongering makes us panic and seize upon the wrong responses to global warming. At a cost of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion annually, the Paris climate agreement, recently ratified by China, is likely to be history’s most expensive treaty. It will slow the world’s economic growth to force a shift to inefficient green energy sources. This will achieve almost nothing. My peer-reviewed research, published last November in the journal Global Policy, shows that even if every nation were to fulfill all their carbon-cutting promises by 2030 and stick to them all the way through the century—at a cost of more than $100 trillion in lost GDP—global temperature rise would be reduced by a tiny 0.3°F (0.17°C). In a rush to do something—and be seen to be taking drastic action—more sensible approaches to counter global warming have been overlooked. Instead of simply mandating less carbon output, we need more R&D spending on green energy, including more efficient fission and fusion, cheaper solar and wind, and improved storage. New technology is crucial if green energy is to out-compete fossil fuels. Policy makers who want to help the residents of the Marshall Islands today should look at improving the islands’ resilience and ability to cope with severe weather by improving infrastructure and storm preparedness. Tackling issues like poverty, health care, corruption and domestic violence would do even more. Those who seek to help should keep the bigger picture in mind.",partial
bda1ddd2,"The truth of climate change is revealed at school Bill Shorten and his allies, the Greens economic vandals, believe climate change is a moral issue. So is telling the truth. With his elite private school education, the Oppo­s­i­tion Leader would have learned about the Roman Warming, the Dark Ages, the Medieval Warming and the Little Ice Age. These took place before industrialisation and were all driven by changes in the sun. He would have learned that ­natural warm times, like now, bring great prosperity, increased longevity and less disease, whereas Jack Frost brings death, depopulation and economic stresses. In biology, the Labor leader would have learned of Darwinism and environmental adapta­tion of species. Humans live on ice and in the hills, valleys, tropics and des­erts, at altitude and on coastal plains. Like countless other organ­isms, we move and adapt when the environment changes. Species thrive when it is warm. READ NEXT QANDA WRAP Should Olympic athletes be vaccinated first? JOSEPH LAM From his education at a relig­ious school, he would have learned about the apostle Thomas. One of the strengths of our Western civilisation is doubt and scepticism. Surely Shorten does not believe the catastrophism promoted by green activists and self-interested alleged experts at the expense of the nation. If he does, he is unelectable. If he is knowingly promoting a falsehood, he is unelectable. Critical thinking was fundamental to our culture and should be embraced in policy formulation. In school science, Shorten would have learned carbon dioxide is the food of life and without this natural gas, which occurs in space and all planets, there would be no life. He also would understand from his maths lessons that when 3 per cent of total annual global emissions of carbon dioxide are from humans and Australia prod­uces 1.3 per cent of this 3 per cent, then no amount of emissions reductio­n here will have any effect on global climate. A quick search would show him that whenever in the past there was an explosion of plant life, the carbon dioxide content was far higher than at present. If we halve the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, all life dies. Shorten should know that for thousands of millions of years the Earth has been changing, with cycles­ and one-off events such as an asteroid impact, super-volcano or a supernova explosion. He should know that climate always changes and that the planet would be in serious trouble if it did not. There are cycles of air, water, rocks and continents. There are measurable cycles with the sun, Earth’s orbit, oceans and moon that drive climate change, especially if cycles coincide. It has yet to be demonstrated that the climate change today is any different from those of the past. Despite hundreds of billions of dollars of expenditure during the past few decades, it still has not been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive ­global warming. Yet wind and solar industrial complexes pepper the landscape allegedly to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. They run on subsidies, not the wind or the sun. Wind and solar are transfering money from the poor to the rich, not saving the environment. These subsidies, paid by the long-suffering consumer and employer, add to emissions because coal-fired elec­tricity needs to be on standby for when there is no wind or sunshine. The amount of energy used to construct solar and wind facilities is greater than they produce in their working lives. The amount of carbon dioxide released during construction and maintenance is far more than is saved. Renew­ables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area, slice and dice birds and bats, kill insects that are bird food, create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them, leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape. Union superannuation funds have invested massively in renewable energy. Labor’s promise of 50 per cent renewables will cost electricity consumers hundreds of billions but will benefit the unions. As soon as renewables were introduced into the grid, electric­ity prices increased and delivery became unreliable. Increased elec­tric­ity costs have created unemployment, and many pensioners and the poor cannot afford electricity. An increase in renewables will make matters worse. Does Shorten’s energy policy consider those who lose jobs and have the power cut off in his race to achieve 50 per cent renewables to fill the pockets of Labor union mates? And what about the scams siphoning off tens of billions that slosh around the world as carbon credits, carbon trading and renewable energy certificates? Rather than take this money from the poor via higher electricity prices, it would be better spent at home. To smugly claim that valid questions about energy costs are dumb or deceitful is a loud warning bell. Shorten refuses to tell us how he will spend our money or to give any detail on energy ­systems that are proven failures. It is our money and, if he will not give us the financial details, we should be very scared of his shiftiness. I have never written a blank cheque for a used car. Why should I now?",partial
0fc59c8b,"Record-breaking climate change pushes world into ‘uncharted territory’ Earth is a planet in upheaval, say scientists, as the World Meteorological Organisation publishes analysis of recent heat highs and ice lows. A boat lies in the dry Cedro reservoir in Quixadá, Brazil. Climate change increases the risk of extreme weather events like drought. The record-breaking heat that made 2016 the hottest year ever recorded has continued into 2017, pushing the world into “truly uncharted territory”, according to the World Meteorological Organisation. The WMO’s assessment of the climate in 2016, published on Tuesday, reports unprecedented heat across the globe, exceptionally low ice at both poles and surging sea-level rise. Global warming is largely being driven by emissions from human activities, but a strong El Niño – a natural climate cycle – added to the heat in 2016. The El Niño is now waning, but the extremes continue to be seen, with temperature records tumbling in the US in February and polar heatwaves pushing ice cover to new lows. “Even without a strong El Niño in 2017, we are seeing other remarkable changes across the planet that are challenging the limits of our understanding of the climate system. We are now in truly uncharted territory,” said David Carlson, director of the WMO’s world climate research programme. “Earth is a planet in upheaval due to human-caused changes in the atmosphere,” said Jeffrey Kargel, a glaciologist at the University of Arizona in the US. “In general, drastically changing conditions do not help civilisation, which thrives on stability.” The WMO report was “startling”, said Prof David Reay, an emissions expert at the University of Edinburgh: “The need for concerted action on climate change has never been so stark nor the stakes so high.” The new WMO assessment also prompted some scientists to criticise Donald Trump. “While the data show an ever increasing impact of human activities on the climate system, the Trump administration and senior Republicans in Congress continue to bury their heads in the sand,” said Prof Sir Robert Watson, a distinguished climate scientist at the UK’s University of East Anglia and a former head of the UN’s climate science panel. “Our children and grandchildren will look back on the climate deniers and ask how they could have sacrificed the planet for the sake of cheap fossil fuel energy, when the cost of inaction exceeds the cost of a transition to a low-carbon economy,” Watson said. Trump is aiming to cut climate change research. But the WMO’s secretary-general Petteri Taalas said: “Continued investment in climate research and observations is vital if our scientific knowledge is to keep pace with the rapid rate of climate change.” 2016 saw the hottest global average among thermometer measurements stretching back to 1880. But scientific research indicates the world was last this warm about 115,000 years ago and that the planet has not experienced such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for 4m years. 2017 has seen temperature records continue to tumble, in the US where February was exceptionally warm, and in Australia, where prolonged and extreme heat struck many states. The consequences have been particularly stark at the poles. “Arctic ice conditions have been tracking at record low conditions since October, persisting for six consecutive months, something not seen before in the [four-decade] satellite data record,” said Prof Julienne Stroeve, at University College London in the UK. “Over in the southern hemisphere, the sea ice also broke new record lows in the seasonal maximum and minimum extents, leading to the least amount of global sea ice ever recorded.” Eel grass grows in sediment at Lowell’s Cove, Maine, US. The rise of sea level has ruined this once rocky location. Emily Shuckburgh, at the British Antarctic Survey, said: “The Arctic may be remote, but changes that occur there directly affect us. The melting of the Greenland ice sheet is already contributing significantly to sea level rise, and new research is highlighting that the melting of Arctic sea ice can alter weather conditions across Europe, Asia and North America.” Global sea level rise surged between November 2014 and February 2016, with the El Niño event helping the oceans rise by 15mm. That jump would have take five years under the steady rise seen in recent decades, as ice caps melt and oceans get warmer and expand in volume. Final data for 2016 sea level rise have yet to be published. Climate change harms people most directly by increasing the risk of extreme weather events and the WMO report states that these raised risks can increasingly be calculated. For example, the Arctic heatwaves are made tens of times more likely and the soaring temperatures seen in Australia in February were made twice as likely. “With levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere consistently breaking new records, the influence of human activities on the climate system has become more and more evident,” said Taalas.",truth
c9a710dc,"Hillary Clinton Boards The Climate Crisis Train To Nowhere Hillary Clinton's plane passes over Manhattan October 11, 2016 as she departs New York en route to a climate change event with former Vice President Al Gore in Miami, Florida. Hillary Clinton and Al Gore spoke at Miami-Dade College on October 11 about the “climate crisis” that Gore has been trying to convince us about for 20 years. Just as in Gore’s movie An Inconvenient Truth, weather disasters that have always occurred have been repurposed to support the climate change narrative, with the claim those disasters are getting worse. Meanwhile, Chapman University has released a survey of the top ten issues Americans fear the most. Guess what? Climate change didn’t make the list. Instead, corruption of politicians was the No. 1 worry. For those who don’t see the relationship between these two newsworthy events, let me connect the dots for you. Global warming and climate change, even if it is 100% caused by humans, is so slow that it cannot be observed by anyone in their lifetime. Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and other natural disasters have yet to show any obvious long-term change. This means that in order for politicians to advance policy goals (such as forcing expensive solar energy on the masses or creating a carbon tax), they have to turn normal weather disasters into “evidence” of climate change. As a climate researcher, I will agree that humans have likely contributed to a portion of recent warmth. I am not a denier of either natural or human-induced climate change. But the observed warming as monitored by satellites (our only truly global monitoring system) has been only about half of what computerized climate models say should be happening. Furthermore, the overall increases in such things as hurricanes and tornadoes have not materialized. Drought in the western U.S. pales in comparison to the mega-droughts tree rings tell us existed in centuries past. Lake-bottom sediments in Florida tell us that recent major hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico has been less frequent than in centuries past. Strong Sandy-type storms occur every year in all the major ocean basins… they just don’t happen to hit major metropolitan areas. It has now, even after Hurricane Matthew, been over 4,000 days since a major hurricane (Category 3 or stronger) has made landfall in the U.S. Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated and still amounts to only 1 inch every ten years. If a major hurricane is approaching with a predicted storm surge of 10-14 feet, are you really going to worry about a sea level rise of 1 inch per decade? If Hillary would have fact-checked her example of sea level rise in Norfolk, Virginia, she would have found out that the experts already know this is mostly due to the land there sinking. To the extent that the cost of weather disasters has risen over time, that is well known to be the result of modern society building more infrastructure in areas that are prone to damage from weather—which is almost everywhere. So, to keep the masses alarmed, politicians must claim that what is normal is actually abnormal—and getting worse. And, furthermore, that only they can fix it … and thereby save your children and grandchildren. And it is that “fix” that really sinks any current plan politicians have to address climate change. Even the modern godfather of global warming, ex-NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies director James Hansen, has admitted that the Paris climate agreement is “a fraud really, a fake.” This is because even if the countries of the world agree to do what they promised on climate change, and that climate change is entirely our fault, and that climate change really will ultimately get bad, the promised actions will have no measurable effect on future global temperatures. You see, many of those countries that have signed on to the Paris Agreement aren’t signing up to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. They are signing up for wealth transfers from the minority of advanced countries to the majority of poor countries. And you can’t even fix the problem with a new agreement. Why? Because until we develop a practical, cost-competitive alternative to fossil fuels, it is unlikely that renewable energy will ever make up more than 15-20% of global energy requirements. The amount of energy necessary for humans to do everything we do is simply too large. As that demand for energy grows, the amount of renewable energy also has to grow, just to maintain only a 15-20% fraction of the total. So, until people actually experience climate change, and new energy technologies are developed, any claims by politicians that we are in a “climate crisis” will fall on deaf ears. And since the biggest risk to humanity is poverty, if we allow policymakers to have their way, the resulting energy poverty will indeed cause the deaths of some of our children and grandchildren.",partial
e6907337,"Turkey joins hands with Pakistan to spread unrest in India New Delhi, Feb 20 (IANS) After a Disinfo Lab report highlighted that the toolkit dropped accidentally by Greta Thunberg had a foreign expert – Pieter Friedrich – as resource point waging a propaganda war against India in collusion with Pakistan’s notorious spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), investigation by a Greek media outlet has revealed that Turkey is an “integral part” of this campaign, aiding Pakistan to spread unrest in India. The Disinfo Lab investigation titled ‘The Unending War: From Proxy War to Info-War’ released earlier this week has exposed the elaborate design which involved a slew of shady companies in the United States, fake foreign experts and even ghost entities to dent India’s peaceful, non-violent image. It mentioned in detail about the linkages of the mastermind waging an info-war/psy-war against India to major terror plot hatched against India in the 1990s in collusion with ISI and how, while taking the cover of Khalistan, the network “still around and connected” works for Pakistani interests. Following the leads from the Disinfo Lab report, an investigation done by a leading Greek news website has decoded the Ankara connection to the entire propaganda being peddled against India, especially during the ongoing farmers protest. “One of the most prominent names revealed in the report and has been promoting Pieter Friedrich’s propaganda as an ‘amplifier’, is Constantinople (Istanbul) based propagandist Ali Keskin. Sources suggest that he is the central figure responsible for coordination between the Pakistani ISI and the Turkish intelligence agency (MIT) on information warfare,” reported Greek City Times. The report said that Turkey has been an integral part of this warfare and has been aiding Pakistan in its disinformation campaign against India. Scanning Keskin’s Twitter handle, the Greek publication said that the war-mongering tweets made by him against India, Greece, France, UAE and Israel were mostly spread by Pakistani handles. “Several investigations by news organisations have revealed that disgruntled with the emerging India-UAE ties, Ali Keskin, with the help of his amplifiers in Pakistan, began a hashtag #BoycottUAE, which became a top trending hashtag within a couple of minutes. This was thanks to the magnification by radical Pakistanis,” the report said. Keskin, the investigation further revealed, has, along with another Turkish journalist Baba Umar “who is believed to be working for the ISI” been assigned to hit countries targeted by Turkey, especially India. The duo has been regularly coordinating with the Pakistani propagandists and promoting each-other’s content. Fredrich too has been producing online content with Umar, attacking India by taking a pro-Pakistani line on Kashmir. “What else does one need as a proof of Khalistani’s aligning with ISI sponsored proxies? The connection between Baba Umar and Pieter Friedrich suggests that Pakistan has started to act as a converging point to bring together all anti-India forces, and Turkey is the new entrant in this group,” an expert on Caucasian affairs told the Greek media outlet. The Disinfo Lab report had highlighted Islamabad’s K-2 (Kashmir-Khalistan) plan and the elaborate design and planning that is underway since 2007 driven by singular motive – to target India’s interest in four major ways: – Targeting idea of India – non-violence & Mahatma Gandhi – replacing it with an alternate image of ‘fascist India’ – Targeting India’s territorial integrity – working towards K-2 design – Targeting India’s interests abroad by working against Indian origin American politicians – Whitewashing Pakistan’s sins – clean chit to Pakistan (ISI) in Kabul Gurudwara Bombings & questioning Pulwama attack The report by Greek City Times also listed several other propagandists like California-based Zahra Billoo – a strong supporter of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Caliphate project – working as foot soldiers in the information war launched by Turkey-Pakistan.

053cbb15,"Greenland's huge annual ice loss is even worse than thought Greenland's huge annual ice loss is even worse than thought. Aerial surveys show two glaciers flowing into Johan Petersen fjord in south-eastern Greenland. The melting of the ice sheet would cause oceans to rise by six metres around the world if it was lost entirely. The huge annual losses of ice from the Greenland cap are even worse than thought, according to new research which also shows that the melt is not a short-term blip but a long-term trend. The melting Greenland ice sheet is already a major contributor to rising sea level and if it was eventually lost entirely, the oceans would rise by six metres around the world, flooding many of the world’s largest cities. The new study reveals a more accurate estimate of the ice loss by taking better account of the gradual rise of the entire Greenland landmass. When the ice cap was at its peak 20,000 years ago, its great weight depressed the hot, viscous rocks in the underlying mantle. As ice has been shed since, the island has slowly rebounded upwards. Previous satellite estimates of modern ice losses tried to take this into account, but precise new GPS data showed much of Greenland is rising far more rapidly than thought, up to 12mm a year. This means 19 cubic kilometres more ice is falling into the sea each year, an increase of about 8% on earlier figures. The southern tip of Greenland seen from space. The faster rebound is thought to be the result of hotter, more elastic mantle rocks under eastern Greenland, a remnant from 40m years ago when the island passed over the hot spot that now powers Iceland’s volcanoes. The new work was also able to reconstruct the ice loss from Greenland over millennia and found that the same parts of Greenland - the north-west and south-east - were where most ice is being lost both in the past and today. This means the rapid ice loss recorded by satellite measurements over the last 20 years is not likely to be a blip, but part of a long-term trend being exacerbated by climate change. Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland’s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea. “The fact that we are seeing such a similarity of past and present behaviour suggests we could lose ice in these regions for decades into the future,” said Prof Jonathan Bamber, at the University of Bristol, UK, and one of the international team of scientists who carried out the new study, published in Science Advances. Bamber said the presence of a long-term trend does not mean global warming is not a crucial factor: “One thing we can be certain of is that a warmer atmosphere and a warmer ocean is only going to accelerate this trend.” “The headlines of climate change and melting polar ice are not going to change,” said Dr Christopher Harig, at the University of Arizona, who was not involved in the study. “The new research happening now really speaks to the question: ‘How fast or how much ice can or will melt by the end of the century?’ As we understand more the complexity of the ice sheets, these estimates have tended to go up. In my mind, the time for urgency about climate change [action] really arrived years ago, and it’s past time our policy reflected that urgency.” Dr Pippa Whitehouse, at the University of Durham and also not involved in the new research, said: “This study highlights the powerful insight that GPS measurements can give into past and present ice loss. Using such measurements, this study demonstrates that some of the highest rates of ice loss across Greenland - both in the past and at present - are found in areas where the ice sheet flows directly into the ocean, making it dangerously susceptible to future warming in both the atmosphere and the ocean.” Melt water on the surface of Greenland ice sheet 10 June, 2014 and 15 June, 2016. Every spring or early summer, the surface of the sheet transforms from a vast white landscape of snow and ice to one dotted with blue meltwater streams, rivers, and lakes. In 2016, the transition started early and fast. The team behind the new research said better estimates of continental rebound rates could be even more significant in estimates of ice loss from the world’s biggest ice cap, in Antarctica, but that sparse data from the remote continent made analysis difficult. In April, very high temperatures led to a record-breaking early onset of glacier melting in Greenland, while another satellite study in August reaffirmed the rapid loss of ice.",truth
16751630,"More acidic oceans 'will affect all sea life' Cold water corals should be more resilient All sea life will be affected because carbon dioxide emissions from modern society are making the oceans more acidic, a major new report will say. The eight-year study from more than 250 scientists finds that infant sea creatures will be especially harmed. This means the number of baby cod growing to adulthood could fall to a quarter or even a 12th of today's numbers, the researchers suggest. The assessment comes from the BIOACID project, which is led from Germany. A brochure summarising the main outcomes will be presented to climate negotiators at their annual meeting, which this year is taking place in Bonn in November. The Biological Impacts of Ocean Acidification report authors say some creatures may benefit directly from the chemical changes - but even these could still be adversely affected indirectly by shifts in the whole food web. What is more, the research shows that changes through acidification will be made worse by climate change, pollution, coastal development, over-fishing and agricultural fertilisers. Ocean acidification is happening because as CO2 from fossil fuels dissolves in seawater, it produces carbonic acid and this lowers the pH of the water. Test tubes Mesocosms (giant test tubes) allow scientists to study acidification effects on real-world organisms. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the average pH of global ocean surface waters have fallen from pH 8.2 to 8.1. This represents an increase in acidity of about 26%. The study's lead author is Prof Ulf Riebesell from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel. He is a world authority on the topic and has typically communicated cautiously about the effects of acidification. He told BBC News: Acidification affects marine life across all groups, although to different degrees. Warm-water corals are generally more sensitive than cold-water corals. Clams and snails are more sensitive than crustaceans. And we found that early life stages are generally more affected than adult organisms. But even if an organism isn't directly harmed by acidification it may be affected indirectly through changes in its habitat or changes in the food web. At the end of the day, these changes will affect the many services the ocean provides to us. On the agenda Since 2009, scientists working under the BIOACID programme have studied how marine creatures are affected by acidification during different life stages; how these reactions reverberate through the marine food web; and whether the challenges can be mitigated by evolutionary adaptation. Some research was done in the lab but other studies were conducted in the North Sea, the Baltic, the Arctic, and Papua New Guinea. A synthesis of more than 350 publications on the effects of ocean acidification - which will be given to climate delegates at next month's summit - reveals that almost half of the marine animal species tested reacted negatively to already moderate increases in seawater CO2 concentrations. Early life stages were affected in Atlantic cod, blue mussels, starfish, sea urchins and sea butterflies. But an experiment with barnacles showed they were not sensitive to acidification. And some plants - like algae which use carbon for photosynthesis - may even benefit. Marine diatoms Organisms that use calcium carbonate to build their bodies will likely struggle Dr Carol Turley, an ocean acidification expert from Plymouth Marine Labs in the UK described the BIOACID research as enormously important. She told BBC News: It's contributed enormous insights into the impacts that acidification can have on a wide range of marine organisms from microbes to fish. It's also explored how in combination with ocean warming and other stressors it might play out at the ecosystem level and affect human society. On the lead-up to the UN climate change negotiations in Bonn this November it is clear that the ocean and its ecosystems should not be ignored. The conference is being held in Germany but it is being chaired by Fiji, which wants delegates to give due prominence to the effects of CO2 on the ocean.",partial
d0b0e459,"Global Ocean Circulation Appears To Be Collapsing Due To A Warming Planet Scientists have long known about the anomalous warming hole in the North Atlantic Ocean, an area immune to warming of Earth's oceans. This cool zone in the North Atlantic Ocean appears to be associated with a slowdown in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), one of the key drivers in global ocean circulation. A recent study published in Nature outlines research by a team of Yale University and University of Southhampton scientists. The team found evidence that Arctic ice loss is potentially negatively impacting the planet's largest ocean circulation system. While scientists do have some analogs as to how this may impact the world, we will be largely in uncharted territory. AMOC is one of the largest current systems in the Atlantic Ocean and the world. Generally speaking, it transports warm and salty water northward from the tropics to South and East of Greenland. This warm water cools to ambient water temperature then sinks as it is saltier and thus denser than the relatively more fresh surrounding water. The dense mass of water sinks to the base of the North Atlantic Ocean and is pushed south along the abyss of the Atlantic Ocean. Schematic of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation This process whereby water is transported into the Northern Atlantic Ocean acts to distribute ocean water globally. What's more important, and the basis for concern of many scientists is this mechanism is one of the most efficient ways Earth transports heat from the tropics to the northern latitudes. The warm water transported from the tropics to the North Atlantic releases heat to the atmosphere, playing a key role in warming of western Europe. You likely have heard of one of the more popular components of the AMOC, the Gulf Stream which brings warm tropical water to the western coasts of Europe. Evidence is growing that the comparatively cold zone within the Northern Atlantic could be due to a slowdown of this global ocean water circulation. Hence, a slowdown in the planet's ability to transfer heat from the tropics to the northern latitudes. The cold zone could be due to melting of ice in the Arctic and Greenland. This would cause a cold fresh water cap over the North Atlantic, inhibiting sinking of salty tropical waters. This would in effect slow down the global circulation and hinder the transport of warm tropical waters north. Measured trend in temperature variations from 1900 to 2012. Melting of the Arctic sea ice has rapidly increased in the recent decades. Satellite image records indicate that September Arctic sea ice is 30% less today than it was in 1979. This trend of increased sea ice melting during summer months does not appear to be slowing. Hence, indications are that we will see a continued weakening of the global ocean circulation system. This scenario of a collapse in AMOC and global ocean circulation is the premise for the movie The Day After Tomorrow. As a disclaimer, the plot line in which much of New England and Western Europe gets plunged into an ice age is significantly over exaggerated and unrealistic on human time scales. While geologists have studied events in the past similar to what appears to be happening today, scientists are largely unsure of what lies ahead.",truth
af8069e0,"Greenland's ice sheet has melted to a point of no return, according to new study (CNN)Greenland's ice sheet has melted to a point of no return, and efforts to slow global warming will not stop it from disintegrating. That's according to a new study by researchers at Ohio State University. The ice sheet is now in this new dynamic state, where even if we went back to a climate that was more like what we had 20 or 30 years ago, we would still be pretty quickly losing mass, Ian Howat, co-author of the study and a professor at Ohio State University, said. Greenland's ice sheet dumps more than 280 billion metric tons of melting ice into the ocean each year, making it the greatest single contributor to global sea level rise, according to Michalea King, the lead author of the study and researcher at Ohio State University. The ice loss has been so massive in recent years, she said, that it has caused a measurable change in the gravitational field over Greenland. ILULISSAT, GREENLAND - In this aerial view melting ice forms a lake on free-floating ice jammed into the Ilulissat Icefjord during unseasonably warm weather on July 30, 2019 near Ilulissat, Greenland. Ice melting in Greenland contributes more than a millimeter rise to sea level every year, and that's likely to get worse. Sea levels are projected to rise by more than 3 feet by the end of the century, wiping away beaches and coastal properties. Coastal states like Florida, and low-lying island nations are particularly vulnerable. Just 3 feet of sea level rise could put large areas of coastline underwater. Forty percent of the US population resides in coastal areas that are vulnerable to sea level rise. There's a lot of places, like in Florida especially, where one meter alone would cover a lot of existing land areas, King said. And that's exacerbated when you get storms and hurricanes and things like that, that then cause extra surge on top of a higher baseline. The study also found that the ice sheet is retreating in rapid bursts, leading to a sudden and unpredictable rise in sea levels, making it difficult to prepare for the effects. The study used four decades of satellite data to measure changes in Greenland's ice sheet. The authors found that after 2000, the ice sheet shrank so rapidly that replenishing snowfall would not keep up with the rate of melting from parts of the glacier newly exposed to warmer ocean water, even if climate change were reversed. Entire coasts of ice are retreating at once due to climate change, Howat said, adding that all 200 glaciers that make up the Greenland ice sheet have been observed retreating within the same episode. Even though the retreat of the Greenland Ice sheet likely cannot be reversed, it's just the first in a series of tipping points. If climate change continues at this rate, the rate of melting will get much worse. We've passed the point of no return but there's obviously more to come, Howat said. Rather than being a single tipping point in which we've gone from a happy ice sheet to a rapidly collapsing ice sheet, it's more of a staircase where we've fallen off the first step but there's many more steps to go down into the pit.",partial
3d1a155a,"The Sea Is Rising, but Not Because of Climate Change There is nothing we can do about it, except to build dikes and sea walls a little bit higher. Ice crevasses near the coast of West Antarctica. Of all known and imagined consequences of climate change, many people fear sea-level rise most. But efforts to determine what causes seas to rise are marred by poor data and disagreements about methodology. The noted oceanographer Walter Munk referred to sea-level rise as an “enigma”; it has also been called a riddle and a puzzle. It is generally thought that sea-level rise accelerates mainly by thermal expansion of sea water, the so-called steric component. But by studying a very short time interval, it is possible to sidestep most of the complications, like “isostatic adjustment” of the shoreline (as continents rise after the overlying ice has melted) and “subsidence” of the shoreline (as ground water and minerals are extracted). I chose to assess the sea-level trend from 1915-45, when a genuine, independently confirmed warming of approximately 0.5 degree Celsius occurred. I note particularly that sea-level rise is not affected by the warming; it continues at the same rate, 1.8 millimeters a year, according to a 1990 review by Andrew S. Trupin and John Wahr. I therefore conclude—contrary to the general wisdom—that the temperature of sea water has no direct effect on sea-level rise. That means neither does the atmospheric content of carbon dioxide. This conclusion is worth highlighting: It shows that sea-level rise does not depend on the use of fossil fuels. The evidence should allay fear that the release of additional CO2 will increase sea-level rise. But there is also good data showing sea levels are in fact rising at a constant rate. The trend has been measured by a network of tidal gauges, many of which have been collecting data for over a century.",partial
8060b507,"Climate Change Isn’t the End of the World Even if world temperatures rise, the appropriate policy response is still an open question. A dike and a windmill in Rotterdam, a city already prone to floods. Climate change is often misunderstood as a package deal: If global warming is “real,” both sides of the debate seem to assume, the climate lobby’s policy agenda follows inexorably. It does not. Climate policy advocates need to do a much better job of quantitatively analyzing economic costs and the actual, rather than symbolic, benefits of their policies. Skeptics would also do well to focus more attention on economic and policy analysis. To arrive at a wise policy response, we first need to consider how much economic damage climate change will do. Current models struggle to come up with economic costs commensurate with apocalyptic political rhetoric. Typical costs are well below 10% of gross domestic product in the year 2100 and beyond. That’s a lot of money—but it’s a lot of years, too. Even 10% less GDP in 100 years corresponds to 0.1 percentage point less annual GDP growth. Climate change therefore does not justify policies that cost more than 0.1 percentage point of growth. If the goal is 10% more GDP in 100 years, pro-growth tax, regulatory and entitlement reforms would be far more effective. Yes, the costs are not evenly spread. Some places will do better and some will do worse. The American South might be a worse place to grow wheat; Southern Canada might be a better one. In a century, Miami might find itself in approximately the same situation as the Dutch city of Rotterdam today.",partial
